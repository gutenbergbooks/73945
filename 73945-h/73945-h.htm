</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> palaces of Brussels, which we have
been visiting to-day are two; that of the
King is a heavy looking building, which
was formerly two houses separated by a
street, which have now been united, and
patched up into one residence, more remarkable
for solidity than beauty. It contains,
however, some splendid rooms, especially
a grand ball-room for state occasions,
and a few paintings of high excellence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
Close by it, is that of the Prince of Orange,
which has been a source of much embarrassment
to the Belgian government. It
was erected for the Prince out of a fund,
voted for the purpose by the nation in recognition
of his military services at Waterloo;
and it was furnished, I think, in part, at least,
at his own charge. But the whole was
barely completed when the Revolution of
1830 drove the Prince, whom the people
so recently delighted to honor, from his
domains and his newly acquired house.</p>

<p>What was now to be done with the
palace! Could the people who had so
recently conferred it on him wrest it back?
Had the Prince of Orange been King, the
case would have been different, but he was
still no more than a private gentleman,
during the life time of his father. He was
not personally responsible for any political
offences charged against the crown, and
the confiscation of his property would,
therefore, have been an act of private wrong.
Still there was not wanting a party among
the <i>esprits forts</i> of the Revolution, to urge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
its appropriation to the purposes of the
state. On the other hand, the Prince naturally
indignant at the expulsion of his
family, hesitated to take any steps for the
removal of his property, and the entire of
the gorgeous furniture, both of this palace
and another at Treveuren on the borders of
the Forest of Soignies, given to him under
the same circumstances, and at the same
time, by the nation, were left behind untouched,
but by no means abandoned, as
they were still under the charge of his domestics
and agents.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, in addition to the national
unwillingness of the Prince by the breaking
up of his establishment, to avow his
consciousness of the utter hopelessness of
the family ever retrieving their lost position;
he may have felt that his deserted
palace, with all its portraits, statues, busts
and paintings, its sumptuous decorations
and elegant and refined bijouterie, left as he
had last used them, apparently, in all the
hurry and alarm of flight, would be a desirable
memento to leave behind him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
the party who still sighed for the restoration
of his house. And that on this consideration,
he was in no haste to make any new
disposition of it.</p>

<p>Be it as it may, however, the palace and
all its contents remained under the protection
of the Belgian government, though
in the actual custody of the Prince’s servants,
down to the final ratification of the
treaty for the independence of Belgium in
1839, and visitors were admitted to its
sumptuous apartments on obtaining an
order from the minister of finance. That
formal abandonment, however, by Holland,
of every recognized claim upon its sequestrated
dominions, left the Prince of
Orange no further pretext for the apparent
desertion of his property, and within
the last few weeks, the contents of the
palace have been in process of removal to
the Hague. The books, the paintings and
bijouterie are already gone, and the rest of
the furniture is speedily to follow, so that,
at present, the only objects to be seen, are
the hangings of embroidered silk and velvet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the superb ormolu candelabra in the ball
room, the gilded chairs, and almost priceless
tables of lapis lazuli and malachite, one
of which has been estimated, I know not
how correctly, at 500,000 francs, and another
at three times that sum. They were
presents from the Emperor of Russia to his
sister the Princess of Orange, together
with the slabs of Siberian granite, with
which the walls of some of the magnificent
saloons are encased, and which is of extraordinary
whiteness and beauty.</p>

<p>The exterior of this really superb residence,
for it is too small to correspond with
our ideas of the magnitude of a palace, is
utterly unworthy of its matchless contents
and internal decorations, but both taken
together, are said to have cost upwards of
twenty millions of francs, and before its
dismantlement, it was beyond all comparison
or question, the most recherché
mansion in Europe. Perhaps the most interesting
apartments are those of the
Princess, consisting of the usual bedrooms,
baths, boudoir, library, and reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
rooms, all of which remained undisturbed
as their illustrious occupant had left them,
when setting out on that journey to the
Hague, whence she little imagined she was
never again to return to Brussels. Her
books and drawings still lay upon the table,
her writing materials and some papers on
the portfolio beside them, and all the
charming little nic-nacs of the boudoir still
remained undisturbed from the disposition
in which her own hand had last arranged
them. It is not possible that the sympathy
which even a foreigner feels on a visit to
such a spot, should not have been warmly
shared by a large proportion of the Belgians
themselves, with these interesting souvenirs
perpetually before them. I presume
the palace will still be left open for the
public; and even if divested of its more
luxurious ornaments, its marble walls, rich
ceilings, and floors of costly marqueterie,
will still render it the bijou of Brussels.</p>

<p>The building in which the Belgian parliament
holds its sittings, is situated in
the same square, on the side opposite to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
that occupied by the royal palace. It is a
large, Grecian edifice, with a considerable
quantity of sculpture and architectural decoration
externally, but within, its passages
and chambers have almost a republican
simplicity and absence of ornament. The
main edifice itself is not new, having been
erected by Maria Theresa, for the ancient
Conseil de Brabant—it now bears the commodious
name of the <i>Palais de la Nation</i>.
Adjoining it, in the Rue de la Loi, the
Downing Street of Brussels, are the official
residences and offices of the ministers of
finances and public works, and the home
and foreign secretaries of state.</p>

<p>The entrance hall is a very large and
low vestibule, paved with dove-coloured
marble, communicating with two staircases,
which lead to the chambers of the commons
and the senate. In conformity with
the anti-aristocratic spirit of the constitution,
which declares the equality of all
orders, the chamber of the upper house has
nothing in its furniture to distinguish it
from the lower, except, indeed, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
latter is by far the larger and more handsome
apartment of the two. That of the
senate is a moderate sized square room,
with a green table surrounded by chairs.
That of the commons is a semi-circle,
lighted from above, surrounded by columns
which support the roof, and fitted up with
benches covered with green morocco, with
conveniences for paper and writing materials
before each member, and in front of
these is the chair of the President, and the
tribune to which each orator advances in
succession to address the house. It is in
the latter chamber that the King opens
and closes, in person, the sittings of the
Assembly, at the commencement and end
of each session.</p>

<p>Instead of the anomalous hours and
seasons of the British Parliament, those of
the Belgian Assemblies are in winter, and at
mid-day, and its discussions open to the public,
with a power invested in any ten members,
to demand a vote of the Chamber for the
exclusion of strangers during any particular
debate. The secretaries at the table, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
members of the House, and take share in
its proceedings. The number of representatives
is regulated by the amount of
population, in the proportion of one member
for every 40,000 inhabitants; and that
of the senate is <i>one half</i> the number of the
other House. The latter are chosen for
eight years, and the former for four, and
the elections take place for the senate every
fourth year, when one half retire, and for
the commons, every second. The qualification
of a senator, is the payment of 1,000
florins a-year of direct taxes, whilst that of a
representative is only two hundred, or about
£10. The members of the lower House
receive each 200 florins a-month, during
the sitting of the house; a distinction is
conferred on the members of the upper of
having neither pay nor perquisites. The
ministers have seats in both assemblies,
and a right to be heard in their discussions,
should they require to speak, but no power
to vote in the divisions; either chamber
may, also, require their presence and explanations
if essential to its deliberations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>The <i>elective</i> franchise, I forgot to state,
varies in amount in the different provinces,
but in all it requires the elector to be
twenty-five years of age, and by birth or
naturalization, a Belgian. A distinction is
also made between the electors of the
towns and the peasants of the same province
who vote for the same member. Thus,
for the province of Antwerp, the elector for
the city must pay, as his qualification,
eighty florins of direct taxes, annually,
whilst the peasant is only required to pay
thirty. In Brussels and Ghent, the sum
is the same as in Antwerp; in Liege, it is
seventy florins; in Bruges, sixty; in Courtrai,
fifty; and in Ostend, forty, down to
thirty-five for some of the smaller city constituencies.
The scale seems to be regulated,
throughout, in proportion to the
agricultural or commercial reputation of the
electoral district; Luxembourg and Namur,
for instance, are the lowest in the list, and
their peasantry pay but twenty florins, or
something less than twenty shillings a-year;
whilst in Limbourg, the qualification is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
twenty-five, and thirty in each of the other
six provinces of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The lower chamber was, till lately, decorated
with two paintings of the battles of
Nieuport and Waterloo. In the latter, the
principal figure was that of the Prince of
Orange, at the moment of his receiving his
wound in the action. This unhappy painting
seems to have been a source of some
embarrassment—to keep such a conspicuous
memento of the expelled dynasty, and
that, too, recording its strongest claim
upon the gratitude of the nation; and,
above all, to leave it suspended in the very
midst of the revolutionary leaders, must
have been peculiarly awkward. But then,
this objection did not extend to the battle
of Nieuport—one of the most decisive victories
of the patriots over the Spaniards in
the war of liberation, and to take down the
one without the other would have looked
peevish. The difficulty seems, however, to
have been surmounted, for we found them
both gone; and that of Waterloo, we saw
in a back apartment, awaiting, perhaps, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
removal to some still more secluded depository.</p>

<p>The Park, which forms the centre of the
square, which is flanked by these public
buildings, is the favourite promenade of
the Bruxellois—the Tuilleries’ garden of
their little Paris, and, in fact, it is <i>a garden</i>,
its dimensions being too small to merit its
more dignified title. Without being either
Dutch or cockney, it contains as many
varieties of ornament as could well be disposed
of in so small a space—broad green
slopes, tall trees and shaded walks, with
fountains, busts and statues in abundance.
Within the gardens, there is a miniature
theatre and a café, and a ball-room, called
La Salle du Wauxhall, and in summer, a
military band plays during the evening
promenade. This little “pleasance” was,
in 1830, the focus of the revolutionary riot,
where the Dutch troops, under the command
of Prince Frederick, made their unfortunate
entry into the city, and after an
interval of carnage and incendiarism, retired,
without a demonstration of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
strength, or a vigorous effort to crush the
revolt. The houses and trees still bear
traces of these sanguinary “three days,”
the latter having their wounds still bound
up with plates of lead and iron nailed over
the spots which were torn by the balls.</p>

<p>The scene which this now peaceful spot
presented on the morning after the departure
of the Dutch troops, is thus described
by an eye witness. “In the park, the
statues, trees, gates, and ornaments were
shattered or defaced; the walks, alleys, and
hollows were strewed with fragments of fire-arms,
gun-carriages, weapons, and military
equipments. Here the mangled bodies of
dead horses obstructed the path; there lay
a still palpitating, half-stripped corpse, and
beside them a dozen others, barely covered
with a few hands-full of earth or leaves.
Ensanguined and discoloured streaks marked
the trace where some wounded victim had
dragged himself from the scene of combat;
and deep indentures in the sand, with dark
coagulated pools, covered by myriads of
insects, indicated the spots where other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
gallant men had made their last death
struggle.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the very midst of this scene of commotion
and carnage, the Hôtel de Bellevue,
the favourite resort of the English, was occupied,
at the moment, by a party of our
fellow countrymen, and a few females of
distinction. In a pamphlet which I picked
up at Brussels, published at the period,
I found the following graphic detail of the
siege which they sustained—a chapter of
real romance, such as occurs in the lives of
but few of the generations of tourists
who annually swarm in Brussels. It professes
to be written by an English officer,
who was one of the party.</p>

<p>“When the King’s troops commenced
the attack on Brussels, on the morning of
the 23d., the English in the Hôtel de Bellevue
consisted of Lady Charles Bentinck,
niece to the Duke of Wellington, and two
daughters, the eldest about thirteen, Mr.
and Mrs. George Harley Drummond, Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>and Miss Wolseley, (an interesting girl),
Captains Dent and Sibbourn, and their respective
servants. The cannonading had
scarcely begun near the <span class="err" title="original: Schræbeck">Schærbeck</span> gate,
when Captains Dent and Sibbourn hurried
to the boulevards, behind the palace of the
Prince of Orange, to observe, if possible,
the advance of the troops, and to see a
nine-pounder belonging to the bourgeois
pointed and served. In a few minutes,
however, they heard the grape-shot rattling
in the trees over their heads, which induced
them to return to the hotel, when, just as
they were turning the corner of the house,
a shell burst within a few yards of them.
This sufficed to show, that on the part of
the troops, the most hostile dispositions had
been determined on. Shells and grape-shot
were thrown in abundance from the rising
ground outside the gate of Schærbeck, along
the Rue Royale, towards the Place Royale.
From the hotel, we had a good view of the
advance of the troops, who were received
by a brisk fire from the bourgeois, who occupied
houses on each side of the street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and who made great havoc amongst the
military; but the latter, by dint of superior
numbers, were not long in reaching the
park, which the bourgeois had, most unfortunately
for themselves, and most unaccountably,
neglected to occupy. They
rushed through the park, and took possession
of the King’s palace, which was also
unoccupied. Rapid, however, as was this
success, they were never able, during the
four day’s fighting, to proceed in this direction,
and all their attempts to gain the
Place Royale proved fruitless, notwithstanding
the very brisk fire they incessantly kept
up against the burghers. It is a curious
fact, that not more than about two hundred
of the latter were upon the Place Royale,
when repeated attacks were made upon it
by the military, but they had three or four
nine-pounders remarkably well served.</p>

<p>With a view to take possession of these
guns, a party of not more than forty lancers,
advanced along that part of the Hôtel
de Bellevue facing the park; but they had
scarcely reached the corner, and got into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the fire, when they faced about, and hastily
retreated as far as the King’s palace. A sharp
fire of both cannon and small arms now
commenced, which continued without interruption
until the final retreat of the
troops. The situation of the English ladies
in the Hôtel de Bellevue became very critical
at this moment. We had all removed
to a room on the second floor, facing the
Place Royale, but some of the burghers
having entered the house, commenced firing
from the roof, which naturally drew upon
the building the fire from the troops.</p>

<p>The rapid succession of shots from and
against the hotel, and the constant fire of
artillery close to its gates, with the shouting
of the people, were enough to intimidate
the stoutest female heart. We found
it absolutely necessary to take the ladies to
a lower part of the house more under cover,
though in descending the great staircase,
they became exposed to a sharp fire of musketry.
However, we succeeded in getting
them safe down. The place of refuge was
the cook’s garde-manger, a sort of cellar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
on a line with, but a few steps lower than
the kitchen. Being vaulted and under
ground, we remained there in comparative
safety until the afternoon of Saturday the
25th. The ladies gradually became accustomed
to the noise of the fire over their
heads, and as two of them were naturally of
a very lively turn of mind, the cellar presented
occasionally a scene of hilarity, fun,
and good humour, which strongly contrasted
with the more frequent one of alarm,
fear, and despondency. It must not be supposed
that the ladies were confined prisoners
during the whole time in the cellar;
curiosity prevailed, even at the risk of life,
and there was many a creep up stairs to
gain a peep at the scene without. At the
same time, it would be unjust to attribute
this motive to one lady, Mrs. Drummond,
whose kind heart and genuine philanthrophy
induced her to visit the wounded
whom they were constantly bringing into
the hall, and to render every assistance in
her power to those brave fellows who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
though in agony, silently but significantly
expressed their gratitude.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Mrs. Drummond had a wonderful escape.
Before she quitted her apartments at the
commencement of the attack upon the
town, shots passed through them, and in
a few minutes afterwards they were filled
with all kinds of projectiles: one ball in
particular lodged itself on the fair lady’s
pillow. In the afternoon of the second day
of the battle, a Belgic gentleman and his
family entered the cellar where they made
good their quarters, having been previously
staying in another part of the hotel nearer
the King’s palace. There was something
in this man’s appearance so disagreeable,
that none of us felt disposed to give him a
a very cordial reception, and the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
proved that we were by no means unworthy
disciples of Lavater. About the middle of
Saturday (the third day) a Liegois chief
came into the cellar evidently with a view
to reconnoitre the party, when Mrs. Drummond,
by one of those sudden impulses
which seem to belong more to the secret
workings of an all-directing providence,
than to spring solely from human foresight,
extended her hand to him, and begged him
to embrace her, intimating at the same time
that she trusted to him for protection. The
chief nobly replied that with his life he
would defend her, and shortly afterwards
left the cellar. The kiss thus bestowed
upon the cheek of this man, dirty and black
as he was from the thick of the fight, was
indeed a most lucky one for us, as it was
certainly the means of saving the lives of
the whole of our party both ladies and gentlemen.
In three or four hours afterwards,
there was more than usual bustle and noise
in the house, in consequence of the burghers
having occupied it in still greater
force, and brought one of their guns into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the yard, ready, upon the opening of a gate,
to pour grape shot upon the troops immediately
opposite in the park. It was at this
moment also, that the Belgic gentleman
hastily entered the cellar, and desired his
family to follow him as quick as possible.
He had scarcely reached the front gate,
when the same Liegois chief above mentioned
seized him as his prisoner. In fact
he was a traitor, and had been strongly suspected
by the burghers of giving provisions
during the night to some officers of the
royal troops through one of the gates facing
the park. Certainly, many circumstances
which it is needless to detail, tended to convince
us that these suspicions were but too
well founded. Had the burghers rushed
into the cellar, there can be no doubt, considering
the highly exasperated state they
were in, that we should all have fallen victims
to their rage. Another Liegois chief
has since told me that having taken compassion
upon this Belgic family, he used
every exertion to restrain the fury of the
burghers, and succeeded in conducting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
them to the Hôtel de Ville; still they were
very roughly handled, and the mother and
daughter (a beautiful girl of seventeen),
were completely covered with mud which
had been thrown at them. There were
now many indications of a most desperate
conflict in and about the hotel, and as our
staying any longer there, seemed to subject
us to the imminent risk of being massacred
by the infuriated Dutch should they gain
possession of the building, or of being
buried in its ruins, should it be battered
down, or set on fire, it became necessary to
take some decided steps. The master of
the hotel appeared to be much agitated.
He had become a marked man from his
having casually harboured the traitor, and
from other circumstances. I shall never
forget the style in which Lady C. Bentinck
addressed him at this moment. She seemed
to be fired with the spirit and decision of
her illustrious uncle, and insisted upon the
master giving his true opinion whether it
was safer to quit, or to remain in the house.
He declined for some time to give an opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
either way, but at last told her she had
better go. Lady Bentinck instantly decided
upon leaving, and the whole party agreed to
follow her example. When in the act of preparing
to depart, five or six armed burghers
entered the cellar and offered to escort us
to a place of greater safety. They had evidently
been sent by the Liegois chief. The
party now left the cellar: arrived at the
gate, some little hesitation being shown,
the Liegois chief whispered to Mrs. Drummond
“<i>Vite vite, Madame.</i>” We sallied out,
Lady Bentinck with her daughters leading the
way. Captain Sibbourn with Mrs. Wollesley
on one side and Miss Wollesley on the
other were the next; behind them were Captain
Dent and Mrs. Drummond, followed
by Mr. Drummond and his little boy, the
whole party being escorted by six burghers.
The latter having conducted us along the
Place Royale as far as the church, desired
us to cross the Place with them <span class="err" title="original: as quickly possible">as quickly
as possible</span>, as we had now to pass through
a very heavy fire of grape shot and musketry.
It was a most trying moment for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
poor women, who could distinctly hear the
shots whizzing past them. When we had
got into the most exposed part of the Place,
Mrs. Wollesley fell down, and it was quite
impossible for Captain Sibbourn to get her
on, as her daughter on his other arm was
on the point of fainting at the sight of her
mother on the ground. But two or three
of the brave burghers, thinking the poor
lady was wounded, ran forward from the
cover under which they were firing, and
carried her on their shoulders. It was quite
a miracle that not one of the party was
touched by a shot. The burghers having
thus got us through the principal danger,
conducted us by bye ways and back lanes
to a house of great safety where we remained
until the next morning, when we
were obliged to go still further off, and to
break up the party by securing such apartments
as we could obtain in different hotels
lower down in the town.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We went to-day to see another of the
great machine manufactories of Belgium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the works of <i>La Société du Renard</i>, which
are the property of a joint stock company,
who purchased them from their original
proprietor. Though on a vast scale, they
are by no means so extensive as the Phœnix
at Ghent; they are calculated for the production
of every description of machinery,
but chiefly of locomotive engines, and the
heavier articles. The establishment is fitted
up for five hundred workmen, but at the
time of our visit, it had not employment
for more than fifty. The chief apartment
is one spacious workshop nearly square,
covered in, and so extensive, as to be traversed
by a railway for the convenience of
moving the heavier pieces. The directors
had no orders in hand at the moment, but
were preparing some locomotives upon
speculation. The cost of one of these of
thirty horse power, is about 40,000 francs.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>I cannot but fear, that these large establishments
have been inconsiderately run up in
Belgium, and that the recent demand for
machinery, both for railroads and factories,
has given a hectic air of prosperity to Belgian
manufactures, that has led to investments
of this kind, far beyond her real
wants. Even at present we find an universal
protestation, that the quantity of
machinery already in action, is more than
sufficient to supply all the demands of her
trade. At Ghent, we found the Phœnix
works fully employed, a circumstance obviously
accounted for, by the simultaneous
erection of three joint stock spinning mills,
but we were told, on the spot, that when the
orders for these were completed, it was not
clearly discernible whence others of similar
importance were to come. In other parts
of Belgium, the same diminution of employment
is seriously felt, and the Renard is, as
I have stated, almost at a stand still. The
railroads of Belgium, when once supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
with engines, cannot possibly be expected
to keep so many and so extensive works in
regular employment, and even now I observed
under a shed at the station of Ghent,
two English locomotive engines from Newcastle,
neither of which had yet been used,
but which were laid aside as a reserve.
The capital sunk in the Renard, is said to
be 700,000 francs, and besides it, there are
three minor houses of the same kind in
Brussels.</p>

<p>Except some print works, bleach-greens,
and others connected with the cotton trade,
Brussels cannot be said to have any manufactures
of importance. The carpets which
bear its name, are all woven at Tournai,
but the competition of England, has seriously
interfered with them in the production of
the ordinary articles, the importation of
which into Belgium has increased since
1830, from the value of twenty thousand
francs, to one hundred and thirty thousand
annually. But in those articles which are
more peculiarly incidental to a capital,
carriages, musical instruments, jewellery, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
furniture, the reputation of Brussels stands
deservedly high. The carriages, especially,
which one sees in Brussels, are remarkable
for their elegance and substantial finish. The
public conveyances also, the fiacres and vigilantes
are superior to those of any city I know
on the continent. It is remarkable, however,
that in common with every other handicraft,
the coach-makers of Belgium are complaining
of depression, there were eighteen establishments
of this kind in Brussels in 1838,
of whom one half only were to be found in
1839.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>One most flourishing branch of trade in
Brussels, is that of books; and more especially
of reprints of French and foreign
literature, with which it plentifully supplies
almost every country of Europe. The value
of the volumes thus produced annually, is
estimated at upwards of <i>six millions</i> of
francs, of which <i>two millions</i>, at least, are for
contrefaçons of foreign literature. In point
of price they are much below that of France,
notwithstanding that their paper is more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>expensive, nor is cheapness their only recommendation,
their typographical beauty
is of the highest order, and some of their
<i>éditions de luxe</i>, illustrated by wood-cuts,
and arabesques are in every way equal to
those of Paris, and much superior to any
attempts hitherto made in England, where
the hardness of our sized paper, prevents the
engravings from delivering a rich impression,
and our pressmen accustomed only to
work with it, want that delicacy of hand,
which is essential to use the soft and spungy
paper of the French and Belgians.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The railroad took us to Antwerp, a distance
of thirty-four miles, in something
more than an hour and a half. As usual the
country lay as level as a bowling-green, and
now and then the line of the railway intersecting
the old paved highway, shewed on
either side a vista of elms and poplars, as
straight as the flight of an arrow, and so
long that no opening was discernible in the
distant perspective: occasionally we flew
past some Dutch looking country box, with
its red roof and whitened walls, its clipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
hedges and grave looking garden, with parterres
of sunflowers and dahlias; and here
and there a grim little château, surrounded
at each angle by a turret, like a pepper-box,
and covered by a tiled roof, as tall and as
sharp as the peaked hat of a burgomaster,
seated in a coppice of alders and firs, and
looking as primitive and secluded as if the
railroad were the first visitant that had
broken in upon its retirement from time immemorial.
One of these pompous little
manor houses, at some distance from the
road between Malines and Brussels, was a
residence of Rubens; and another called the
Dry Thoren or Three Towers, not far from
it at Perck, was the property of Teniers.
The intention of the great perpendicularity
in the roofs, in the Low Countries, was to
prevent the lodgment of snow in their severe
winters, and in the towns were building
ground was so extremely valuable, to obtain
rooms for storing fuel and other bulky articles,
without trenching upon the space
below.</p>

<p>The road between Malines and Antwerp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
passes through the hamlet of Rosendael,
(the Vale of Roses) where there was formerly
a rich abbey of Cistercian monks.
Duffill, a small manufacturing town, and a
village bearing the remarkable name of
<i>Vieux Dieu</i>, from a pagan temple, which is
said to have been erected there at some
remote period, and the site of which is
pointed out in a clump of elms, a “sacred
grove,” within which an altar is still erected
on the occasion of any religious procession
in the parish. Approaching Antwerp, the
surface of the land becomes more uneven,
much of it has been recovered from the
rivers which traverse it, and is sunk in deep
rich <i>polders</i>, which the roads traverse upon
raised causeways. The agricultural toil
seemed here to be extensively shared by
the women, who were busied in its most
laborious processes.</p>

<p>The first feature of Antwerp is the soaring
and majestic tower of its Cathedral,
springing from three to four hundred feet
above the level plain. Beyond any comparison,
this is the most chaste and beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
steeple I have ever seen, its extraordinary 
height between three and four hundred
feet, being less surprising than its airy and
graceful lightness. It tapers up arch above
arch, not in solid masonry, but pierced with
innumerable openings, through which the
clear blue sky is seen through the gothic
net-work of its minarets and spandrils. It
was of this handsome spire, that Charles
V. said, it should be preserved under glass,
and Napoleon with more vraisemblance,
observed, that it reminded him of <i>Mechlin
lace</i>. The entrance to the city, by the
Porte de Borgerhout, gives a striking impression
of its great strength, its fortifications
rising in huge mounds of brickwork,
above broad and river-like fosses, and
the road after passing draw-bridge after
draw-bridge entering a ponderous arch,
apparently hollowed out of the ramparts,
on emerging from which the wheels rattle
and re-echo over the rough pavement of the
narrow gloomy streets, that lead into the
heart of the city.</p>

<p>Its appearance is like that of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
other ancient fortified towns of the Low
Countries, where the circuit of the city,
being girt in and determined by the line of
the walls, the necessity of economizing
space led to the construction of gloomy
passages, and lofty houses that overshadow
the street, and keep the sun from ever
shining upon the pavement. Towards the
centre of the town, however, there are some
ample streets, and a lively square, the <i>Place
Vert</i>, planted with trees and surrounded on
all sides by hotels, cafés, and modern houses
of great elegance. In the <i>Place de Mer</i>,
there is a spacious mansion, surmounted by
the royal arms, which is dignified with the
name of a palace, but was merely the mansion
of a merchant of Antwerp, and was
purchased by Napoleon, as a residence for
himself and his marshals, on their temporary
visits to the city. It is still retained for
the same purpose by King Leopold. In an
adjoining street, which bears his name, is
the house and garden of Rubens, the site of
which he purchased from the corporation of
the Arquebusiers, whose hall was next door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
in exchange for his great picture in the
Cathedral, of the “Descent from the Cross.”
The generality of the houses are built of
dark sand-stone, without any architectural
decoration, except their castellated gables,
which, as usual, are turned upon the street;
the windows are generally furnished with
espions, and at many of the corners, niches
in which are seated tawdry Madonnas,
covered with a profusion of brocade and
copper lace. The weather became rainy
before we left, and this together with the
want of footways to the streets, the filth of
the centre, and the odours which the unusual
stream of water awoke from every sewer,
left our impression of the domestic comforts
of Antwerp, less agreeable, than it
might have been, had we seen it under the
influence of light and sunshine.</p>

<p>Antwerp like all its fellow cities in Belgium,
boasts an origin of obscure antiquity,
so remote as the fifth or sixth century, it
is said,—but at all events in the tenth, it was
of sufficient importance to constitute a Marquisate
for Godfrey of Bouillon, the hero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of Tasso, and the King of Jerusalem, the
unexpected arrival of whose followers from
the Holy Land, in January 1100, has been
commemorated in a festival still observed
by the women of Antwerp, as the Vroukens-Avond,
or the <i>Ladies’ Eve</i>, in remembrance
of the domestic fêtes which welcomed their
return.</p>

<p>Two hundred years after, it was annexed
along with the province of Lower Lorraine,
to the Duchy of Flanders, and along with
it passed successively under the dominion
of Burgundy, Germany and Spain, sharing
in all the vicissitudes and disasters which
befel the rest of the Netherlands, under
their various dynasties.</p>

<p>Antwerp contests with Holland and
Germany, the glory of the discovery of
printing. Little books of devotion, printed
there, from solid blocks, early in the fourteenth
century, are still in existence;
numbers of volumes in moveable types,
bear its name and the date of 1476; and
during the sixteenth century, in the days of
Plantin, it was one of the most extensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
seats of printing in Europe, all the productions
of its press, and especially its classics,
being in the highest repute.</p>

<p>The original citadel and fortifications
were erected by Philip II, which were
strengthened and enlarged in the reign of
Charles V, at a time when Antwerp was one
of the first commercial cities in Europe.
Its manufactures of linen and silk were
then exported to every part of the world;
its woollen trade was the parent of the same
manufacture in Great Britain, and its local
historians, perhaps with some exaggeration,
describe its commerce as so flourishing,
that the population supported by it,
exceeded one hundred thousand souls,
(though one is puzzled to discover where
they found accommodation within its walls)
and fifty thousand sailors and travellers on
the river and in the faubourgs; and Scribanius
declares that he has seen 2500 vessels
in the Scheldt at a time, of which five hundred
daily entered the river, whilst two
thousand lay at anchor before the city;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
but, “<i>pour être témoin <span class="err" title="original: veredique">véridique</span>, il ne suffit
pas toujours d’être témoin oculaire</i>.” It was
in this era of its splendour, that one of its
merchants entertaining Charles V, at a
banquet, kindled a fire of cinnamon, then
a costly rarity, with the Emperor’s bond
for two millions of florins, observing, “that
the honor of having such a guest at his
table, was infinitely more precious than the
gold.” Its prosperity was, however, annihilated
a century <span class="err" title="original: latter">later</span>, when at the treaty
of Munster, which closed the Thirty years’
war in 1648, Holland had sufficient influence
to obtain the closing of the Scheldt.
For nearly one hundred and fifty years,
this noble river flowing through the midst
of one of the most active and industrious
countries in Europe, was forbidden to be
navigated by a single native sail, every
vessel which bore produce for Antwerp,
being compelled to transfer her cargo to
a Dutchman under whose flag alone it
could reach its destination. This unnatural
embargo was terminated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
French in 1794, and Antwerp under the
dominion of France, rose again into new
and augmented importance.</p>

<p>Napoleon, enamoured of his theory, that
France was nothing unless with the Rhine for
her eastern boundary, and the Scheldt for the
northern station of her navy, conceived numerous
projects for its realization. At one
time planning to build a city at Terneuse,
at another, fixing on the vast alluvial plain
that surrounds the Tête de Flandres, but
finally determining to make Antwerp, herself,
the object of his ambitious care, and
render her, in his own words, “a pistol,
perpetually at the throat of England.”
With this view, its military defences were
all restored—huge basins constructed at
the east of the city, capable of floating, one
twelve, and the other forty vessels of the
line, and store-houses, rope-walks, and sail
manufactories; everything, in short, for
the equipment of an arsenal, were prepared
upon a gigantic scale.</p>

<p>In acknowledgment of these magnificent
favours conferred upon their city, the merchants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
of Antwerp presented Napoleon with
a frigate, fully equipped and stored. In
1807, ten vessels of the line had been built
at Antwerp; in 1813, <i>thirty</i> ships of war
had been launched, and fourteen others
were still upon the stocks. The fall of the
Emperor, however, preceded that of his intended
victim, and by the treaty of Paris
in 1814, his vast constructions at Antwerp
were ordered to be demolished—his buildings
and magazines were all destroyed—the
vessels of war found within the basins, were
portioned out between Louis XVIII and
the Prince of Orange, and the docks, alone,
were spared from destruction, partly from
the difficulty of accomplishing it, and partly
at the entreaty of the merchants of Antwerp,
as a harbour of refuge for their ships, which
were liable to serious injury from the ice,
which, in winter, is borne down the swollen
current of the Scheldt.</p>

<p>The period of its union with Holland,
however, from 1815 to 1830, may be said
to have been the golden age of Antwerp.
Its situation for trade is by far more favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
than either Rotterdam or Amsterdam,
and being admitted, along with them, to an
equal participation in all the resources of
the kingdom, it rapidly outstripped them
in every department of trade, so much so,
that, at the period of the revolution, “<i>Antwerp
did more business, in every article of
colonial produce, with the exception of tobacco,
than Amsterdam and Rotterdam united.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The events of the revolution put an instantaneous
check to this career of affluent prosperity;
Antwerp, compelled to form a portion
of the independent kingdom without colonies,
or commerce, or foreign relations, found her
shipping laid up idle in her docks, and her
merchants, conscious of the ruin which had
overwhelmed their prospects at home, transferred
their capital, and their exertions to
Holland, and united their fate to that of
their now triumphant rivals. In 1838, all
the ports of Belgium possessed but one
hundred and eighty-four sail of merchant
vessels, of whom one hundred and fifty-two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>were employed merely in the coasting
and channel trade, and thirty-two in foreign
voyages, whilst, in the same year, Holland
had no less than 1400 sail.</p>

<p>From the events of 1830, and their results,
Antwerp never has, and never can,
thoroughly recover. For some years after
the Repeal of the Union, her quays and harbour
were literally motionless and empty;
and, at the present moment, even with occasional
revivals, her trade appears to have
only the fate of Venice or of Genoa in prospect.
Her chief employment is in carrying
the raw material which is to supply her
own manufactures, and which she must do
at a disadvantage in freights, as her shipments
in return fall far short of her importations.
Of 2662 Belgian vessels, which
cleared out from her various ports between
1831 and 1836, no less than 739 <i>went out
in ballast</i>!</p>

<p>In the years immediately succeeding the
revolution, the shipping trade of Antwerp
seemed to undergo an absolute paralysis.
In 1829, the year preceding the Repeal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the Union, 1028 vessels entered the port,
amounting to a tonnage of 160,658
tons. In 1831, the year after the Repeal,
only 398 vessels entered the Scheldt with a
tonnage of 53,303 tons! Since that period, a
superficial glance at the returns, would lead
to a belief that the trade had more than
recovered itself.</p>

<p>But on coming to scrutinize this table by
the test of the relative quantities in cargo
and in ballast, the air of prosperity grows
fainter, and the real nature of the trade more
distinct. It appears by the following table,
that of 5694 which <i>arrived</i> in all the ports
of Belgium in the years 1835, 1836 and
1837, the entire were freighted with cargoes,
except 141. Whilst of 5707 which cleared
<i>outwards</i> in the same time, no less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
1833 left Belgium in ballast, in other words
arrived with the produce of other countries,
but departed without carrying away any
Belgian manufacture in return.</p>

<p>Antwerp and Ostend are suffering, also,
by being defrauded of their fair proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
of legitimate commerce by the extensive
system of contrabandism, which prevails
upon all the Belgian frontiers, and is carried
on in foreign vessels; a loss to which they
would not be subject, were the government in
a position to protect the portion of trade to
which the country must still give employment,
by an effectual system of the <i>douane</i>
upon the frontiers and the coast.</p>

<p>Antwerp had once a most extensive manufacture
of silk; in 1794, there were twelve
thousand workmen employed in that branch
alone. The number is now reduced to two
hundred, and their only employment is in
producing a beautiful description of rich
black taffetas, which is used for the Spanish
head-dresses, still worn by females.</p>

<p>Another most important branch of <span class="err" title="original: maratime">maritime</span>
trade, that of the transit of goods for
consumption in the interior of Europe, has
been almost entirely drawn from Antwerp
by the Dutch, but the government hope to
recover it, by means of the railroad, from
the sea to the Rhine. Here, again, the
most formidable opposition may be looked
for from Holland, whose vessels on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Rhine are prepared to dispute with her the
possession of this important department.
Independently of the fact, that the carriage
of goods by railway in England, where
it has been most extensively tried, has not,
as yet, answered the expectations of its projectors;
the Dutch, having by their recent
treaty with Prussia, obtained the free navigation
of the Rhine, on the same footing as
those vessels which bear the Prussian flag,
will be disposed to make sacrifices in their
freights, in order to underbid their rivals by
land; the loss on which will be a very trifle
compared with that which must ensue, if the
Belgians are disposed to play out the same
“desperate game with cold iron.” At the
present moment, I am told, that the Rhinvaeders,
of from two hundred to three hundred
tons burthen, carry goods for from
eight to nine florins the <i>last</i>, from Rotterdam
to Cologne. This charge, it is natural
to suppose, they will be able to reduce, so
soon as a competition is instituted by the
railroad. The advantage on the side of the
latter will be manifest, as regards the item
of time, the journey to Cologne by the railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
occupying but twenty-four hours, for
what may require a number of days by the
Rhinvaerder. But the question is—can
the directors, or rather the government,
whose property it is, reduce the carriage so
low, as, with charges of all kinds, to underbid
the Dutch to such an extent as to command
a preference? A Belgian gentleman,
who spoke to me in high hopes as to the
ultimate success of the railroad in the struggle,
admitted, at once, that it could only be
achieved by a dead loss upon the adventure—<i>which,
however, he said, the government
would, as usual, bear out of the taxes</i>! Well
may the merchants of Antwerp apply to the
concocters of the revolution, the complaint
against those who, “intending to build a
tower, set not down first and count the cost
thereof.”</p>

<p>A journey to Antwerp is a pilgrimage to
the shrine of Rubens. Rubens is the tutelary
idol of Antwerp—it was his home,
though not his birth-place—his favourite
residence, and the scene of his triumphs;
and he has left to it the immortal legacy of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
fame, his master-pieces, his monument, and
his grave. Its museum and its churches
are enriched by his principal pictures; and
the inhabitants pay back, in grateful homage
to his memory, the renown which his
genius has entailed upon them. Fêtes in
his honour, on a style of great magnificence,
had been celebrated but a few weeks before
our visit; to inaugurate his statue, which
was crowned by the city, amidst public
rejoicings, processions, music, banners,
and all the pomp of civic triumph. The
excitement had not yet subsided, and
we found every table covered with portraits
of the great painter, verses in his praise,
and programmes of the recent festivals;
and, with every individual, the absorbing
topic was something connected with his
name and his monuments.</p>

<p>Antwerp has long been entitled to distinction
as a nursery of the arts. The list
of painters which she has produced is quite
surprising; and in addition to those with
whom we are familiar, as Teniers, and Vandyke,
and Snyders, her churches abound in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
pictures by natives of the city—by Metsys,
and Florus, and Jansens, Quellyn, Seghers,
Crayer, Franc, Jordaens, and a multitude
of others, who form a numerous gallery in
themselves. Her enthusiasm in the cultivation
of genius seems never to have flagged,
and its unimpaired appreciation, at the present
day, is attested, not only by the pride
of its population in their public treasures,
museums and churches, but by the vast
number of private collections, at the houses
of its nobility and merchants, which abound
with the choicest pictures of the Dutch and
Flemish schools, those of other countries
being less eagerly sought after. From
fifteen to twenty of these private galleries
exist in Antwerp; and an equal ambition
prevails throughout to maintain the ancient
character of the city, by the patronage of
its living artists. We saw an exhibition of
modern pictures, in a room attached to the
museum, which contained some of unusual
ability, especially landscapes and cattle,
amongst which some sheep and cows by
Verboeckhoven of Brussels, eminently entitle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
him to the epithet which his countrymen
are fond of bestowing on him, of the
Landseer of Belgium.</p>

<p>The Museum in which a large collection
of Rubens and Vandyke’s pictures are deposited
is an ugly suite of rooms in an
obscure corner, the building having been a
suppressed convent. It is situated in a little
garden, ornamented, or rather disfigured by
some wretched statues, as if their worthlessness
was meant to serve as a foil to the
gems within doors. It is curious that that
which ought to be a native collection does
not contain a single piece of Teniers, except
one wretched thing which it is libellous to
ascribe to his pencil, and only two of
Snyders. In England, where the best
pictures of Rubens’ pencil are comparatively
unknown, and where our countrymen are
accustomed only to his allegorical subjects
and ungraceful women, the homage rendered
to his abilities is, I think, rather an echo of
his continental fame than a genuine appreciation
of his merits; but any one who
wishes thoroughly to estimate his loftier
pretensions, and ardently to admit his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
claims to admiration, should visit the Museum
and the <span class="err" title="original: Catheral">Cathedral</span> of Antwerp. Here
his pictures evince not power alone, not
merely that wonder-creative imagination
that peoples the canvass with the most
masterly compositions, but they exhibit a
sweet adherence to nature, a rich perception
of beauty, and a magical command of expression
and action, that makes the canvass
record the event it commemorates like a
page of history or the voice of a poet. It is
impossible, for instance, to look at “the
Descent from the Cross” without almost
expecting the attitudes to change as the act
proceeded, so eager and intent are the countenances
of his figures, and so earnest and
real their occupations; and in the same way
in the picture of “<i>the Crucifixion</i>,” where the
Centurion has already broken one of the legs
of the malefactor on the left, who has torn it
from the cross under the agony of the stroke,
and the soldier has the iron raised to crush the
other; one’s very flesh thrills in anticipation
of the scream that seems about to issue from
the excruciated lips of the sufferer. This is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
marvellous picture in every respect, and
certainly the pride of the Museum; each
individual figure is a perfect episode—Christ
himself, in all the dignified calm repose of recent
death; the soldier, with his hand raised
to pierce his side, whilst Mary Magdalene,
who seems in a paroxysm of suffering,
to have been clinging around the foot
of the cross, springs forward in a sudden
agony of terror, with her arms outstretched
to intercept the spear. This head
of the Magdalene, Sir Joshua Reynolds pronounces
to be “the most beautiful profile
he ever saw of Rubens or any other painter.”
Finely contrasted with the stirring action of
these figures, is the expression of the mother
of Jesus, who appears stupified by the exhaustion
of her very sufferings, and that of
the good Centurion, who leans forward over
the neck of his horse in evident sympathy
and horror at the scene before him.</p>

<p>“<i>The Adoration of the Magi</i>” is another
picture of Rubens, well known in England
from its innumerable engravings. It is,
however, in every respect inferior to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Crucifixion, though a superb picture. But
there are two charming paintings, the insensible
attraction of which is, perhaps, the
sweet repose of the subject; one a Christ
exhibiting his wounds to satisfy Thomas’s
incredulity, and the other the Virgin instructing
St. Anne. It is impossible for
any creature to sit before these, and another
exquisite little copy of “The Descent from
the Cross,” and to retire from them unimbued
with a veneration for the genius that
could conceive and embody such imaginings.
There are in all fifteen paintings
of Rubens in this collection, and they are
certainly triumphs of his easel; the gallery
at Munich possesses no less than <i>ninety-five</i>
of his works, but after having seen both, I
would rather have five of these at Antwerp
than the ninety-five which are the boast
of Bavaria.</p>

<p>There are five or six pictures by Vandyke,
but they are in the same style with Rubens,
groups from sacred subjects; and they do
not bear to be placed in such immediate
contact with the chefs-d’œuvres of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
master. Vandyke’s unrivalled portraits,
and his single figures are as much superior
to those of Rubens, as the latter excels
him in combination and compositions.
Their productions are as an epic poem to a
lyric or a sonnet; and whilst Rubens is
the Homer of his art, Vandyke may be well
contented to be its Pindar or Plutarch. The
rest of the walls are occupied with the canvass
of the other second rate names which have
competed for fame with these great originals,
Van Thulden, Seghers, Jordaens, <span class="err" title="original: Ve Vos">de Vos</span>,
and a picture by Quellyn, which, I presume,
to be the largest in the world upon canvass,
as it occupies the entire end of the gallery,
from the ground to the roof, and must be,
at least, forty feet broad by sixty or seventy
high. With the exception of Rubens and
Vandyke, in fact, the collection is commonplace.
In one of the halls is appropriately
placed, as a relic of Rubens, the gilt leather
chair which he occupied when president of
the academy. Unfortunately it has not
proved the tripod of the Pythoness to his
successors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>I think it is Dr. Clarke who advises every
traveller, who wishes speedily to map the
spot in which he finds himself in his memory,
to take the earliest opportunity of
ascending the nearest tower or mountain,
and I am most fully prepared to certify for
its advantages. One half-hour on the tower
of the Cathedral of Antwerp will give a
stranger a better idea of its localities and
extent, than a week’s driving around
its streets and environs. The Cathedral
itself is situated near the pretty little square
called the <i>Place Vert</i>, (which was, I think,
at one time a burying-place attached to the
church). The building itself is defaced, as
usual, by a number of ordinary houses erected
against its walls, and which, of course,
cover up all the exterior beauty of the
architecture. It stands, tradition says, on
a spot of ground which belonged to a
monastery founded by Godfrey of Bouillon.
The exquisite steeple, however, was built
shortly before the reign of Charles V., (who
stood as godfather to the great Bell,) from a
design which originally contemplated two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
towers of equal grandeur and elegance, but
one only was completed. The ascent is fatiguing
in the extreme; and as the day was
stormy, the vibrations of the tower were
sensibly felt as the wind rushed through its
beautiful galleries. Workmen have been
employed for some years in restoring all the
decayed portions of the stone-work, and the
steeple is still filled with their scaffolding
and machinery. But the view, long before
gaining the extreme summit, is by far the
finest in Belgium, extending, as it does,
over the broad current of the Scheldt,
whose windings can be traced from Ghent
to Flushing, whilst to the north, the eye can
reach Breda and the frontiers of Holland;
to the south and east, the distant cities of
Brussels, Mechlin, Turnhout, and Louvain.
The vast extent of country which is swept by
one of these Flemish prospects is really
quite inconceivable, whilst the absence of
a single hill to intercept the horizon upon
either side, renders them as peculiar as they
are surprising.</p>

<p>Over the grand doorway, as we enter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
below the tower, is a crucifix in bronze,
which was cast from the fragments of a statue
which the Duke of Alva erected to himself
upon the Citadel, with the insulting motto
on its pedestal “<i>ex ære captivo</i>,” in allusion
to its being made out of the cannon, taken
in his first successful battle against the
Prince of Orange at Jeminghem, near
Emden in 1568. This memorable statue
gave origin to the distich,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Cur statuam vivo tibi Dux Albane dedisti?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An quia defuncto nemo daturus erat?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Requesens, the successor of Alva, in his
anxiety to conciliate the people, took down
this record of their sufferings, and concealed
it, but being discovered by the citizens after
the “Pacification of Ghent,” it was by them
melted and applied to its present purpose.</p>

<p>Opposite the Cathedral, in the square, is a
gothic screen of iron work, which covers a
fountain; tradition says it was made by
Quentyn Metsys, “the blacksmith of Antwerp,”
an operative Cymon, who was converted
into an artist by the charms of a
Flemish Iphigenia, whose father consented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to her marriage only when her lover had
become a painter. An inscription on a
stone, near the great door of the Cathedral,
which enrols Metsys as a “pictor incomparabilis
artis,” acknowledges the obligation
of the arts to the attractions of his mistress.</p>

<blockquote><p>
“Connubialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellem.” 
</p></blockquote>

<p>The body of the church within is of immense
extent, so great, indeed, that our
cicerone ventured to say it was five hundred
feet in length, and half that in breadth at
the transepts. The gothic arcades, which
separate the nave from the side aisles are of
prodigious height, and with the innumerable
pillars that support the organ and surround
the choir, the coup-d’œil, at entering, presents
quite a forest of columns; “these,
and the dim religious light,” falling upon
the monuments around, from lofty windows
emblazoned with armour, and the effigies of
ancient ecclesiastics; and streaming downwards
from the richly painted dome give
an air of solemnity to the whole as striking,
though by no means so magnificent, as
Westminster Abbey. Before the period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the French revolution, and whilst Antwerp
was still the seat of a bishopric, (it is now
appended to the see of Malines), the Cathedral
was one of the richest in Europe,
abounding in altars of marble, candelabra of
silver, paintings, statues, and jewels, which
were all despoiled or destroyed by the followers
of reason. Among them was an <i>ostensoir</i>
for holding the holy elements of the host,
in massive gold, which had been a gift from
Francis I. The treasury is still abundantly
supplied with donations of a similar kind,
though of less intrinsic cost perhaps, and
its innumerable chapels, with their altarpieces
and ornaments, its sumptuous choir,
and astonishing carved pulpit by Verbruggen,
covered with allegories and quaint
devices, form a scene which is remarkably
imposing.</p>

<p>The innumerable paintings which are
hung in every space, might, elsewhere, receive
a suitable homage of admiration, but
here, eager expectation leads one only to
the triumphs of Rubens. Rubens has four
superb pieces here, “The Elevation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Cross,” “<i>The Descent from the Cross</i>,”
“The Resurrection,” which adorns the
tomb of Moretus, the printer, and the
“Assumption of the Virgin,” over the centre
of the grand altar. I never saw a more
striking illustration of the power of a picture,
than the effect produced by the Descent
from the Cross. It was closed by
its two folding volets when we entered, the
backs of which contain, likewise, two designs
by Rubens, one of St. Cristopher,
the patron saint of the guild of arquebusiers,
for whom he painted the picture, and the
other, of a hermit, neither of them of great
merit. These engaged no attention, apparently,
but when, bye and bye, the sacristan
moved them to either side, and
displayed the astonishing picture within,
the effect was quite remarkable—the loungers
and passers-by were now arrested, one
by one, as they came within the circle of
attraction, till a little crowd of peasants
and soldiers were collected before it, in
the most breathless attention, and, as if
struck with a new sensation, I saw them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
look silently in each others’ faces, apparently
to discover whether others felt as
they did themselves. One girl, with a
basket on her arm was caught at once, as
she passed, and remained with the rest,
quite abstracted in contemplation; it recalled
Wordsworth’s exquisite description
of the street musician by the Pantheon:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And the guilt-burthened soul is no longer oppress’d.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That errand-bound 'prentice was passing in haste—</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>She sees the musician, ’tis all that she sees</i>!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The genuine admiration of this artless
assemblage, was as marked a triumph to
the genius of Rubens, as the pecking of the
birds at his basket of fruit was to the execution
of Apelles. I never saw such a rebuke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
to the “cant of criticism,” and I could
not but feel it to be a compensation for the
judgment of Sir Joshua Reynolds, who, I do
not know why, professes to have been <i>disappointed</i>
with its excellence. The picture
was painted for the corporation of gun-smiths,
in order to compose a quarrel as to
the ownership of a stripe of ground, on
which they alleged that Rubens had encroached,
in the erection of his house and
gardens. Another story concerning it, is
that the pupils of Rubens, in their romps
during his absence, had thrown down one
of their number, who in his fall, had rubbed
out the arm of the beautiful Magdalene,
and that, in order to restore it before the
return of their master, they selected Vandyke,
who repaired it with so much ability,
that Rubens acknowledged its superiority
to the original. The painting, like all the
other treasures of Belgium, was one of
the ornaments of the Louvre, during the
reign of Napoleon.</p>

<p><i>The tomb of Rubens</i> is in a little chapel,
consecrated especially to his family, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Church of St. Jacques; it is situated immediately
in the rear of the high altar and
the choir. Its only ornament is an exquisite
picture of a Holy Family, by “the
illustrious dead,” in which he has introduced
portraits of himself as Saint George,
his two wives, Isabel Brandt and Helen
Forman, as Martha and Mary, his father as
St. Joseph, his grandfather as Time, and
his child as a cherubim. In a vault beneath,
is laid the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">dust which is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even in itself an immortality.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">It is covered by a single slab of marble,
with an inscription which records the talents
and the learning of the Seigneur of
Steen (Stein i toparcha), of whom it says,
“<i>non sui tantum seculi, sed et omnis ævi
Apelles dici meunt</i>. His genius,” it proceeds
to say, “elevated him to the friendship
and the confidence of kings and
princes; so that when named a counsellor
of state, by Philip IV, King of Spain and
the Indies, and despatched as his ambassador<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to the court of England, he laid the
basis of peace between his Sovereign and
King Charles II. His family are now extinct,
and this monument to his memory,
which had long, as the inscription says,
been neglected by his last descendants, was
restored in 1775, by one who was then a
canon of the cathedral, and who traced a
relationship with the great painter in the
maternal line, “<i>ex matre et avia nepos</i>.””</p>

<p>The church which contains this interesting
tomb, is, in proportion to its extent,
the most splendid in Antwerp. In its
chapels there are some sculptures in marble,
in alto-relievo, of surprisingly elaborate
execution, and of merit sufficient to
entitle them to a visit to Paris, which they,
of course, made under the paternal government
of the Emperor. Its walls are, also,
covered by quantities of Flemish pictures
of value, adorned with statues by Verbruggen,
Willemsens and Quellyn.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the <i>Church of St. Paul</i>
is a “Calvary,” one of those exhibitions
of the sufferings of Christ, that by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
coarseness of their conception and their
barbarous execution, create a feeling of disgust
in any mind of intelligence or taste,
and to the ignorant, whom they are intended
to attract, must connect the solemn
idea of the Saviour with the most coarse
and revolting associations. It consists of
a vast crowd of horrid-looking statues to
represent the faithful priests, holy men,
and prophets, surrounding a rock, out of
and in which, a number of angels and saints
are flying and walking; and below, a tomb,
with the body of the Saviour on a bier—the
whole surrounded by little holes and recesses,
in which the wicked are represented,
undergoing all the tortures of purgatory, in
forms and attitudes as varied, at least, if
not so poetical, as those of Dante. The
interior of the church abounds, as usual,
with statues and paintings, amongst which
are some of Teniers and Vandyke, and the
grand altar is decorated by a masterly statue
of St. Paul from the chisel of Vanbruggen.</p>

<p>The <span class="err" title="original: congregration">congregation</span> was assembled for
vespers when we entered the Church of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Augustines to see Rubens’ picture of “The
Marriage of St. Catherine.” It is quite
opposed to all our protestant feelings of the
decorum and reverence due to the solemnity
of public worship, to see the indifference
and almost rudeness with which the valets-de-place
conduct their parties of sightseers
around a church, regardless of its
most impressive ceremonies, brushing past
the altar in the full blaze of its panoply,
and disturbing the devotions of all who
may intercept their view of a picture. It
was almost painful to listen to the “cant of
criticism,” amidst the chanting of anthems,
clouds of incense, and the solemn pealings of
the organ, but it appeared to excite no such
feeling in those around us. With us, however,
in England, the outward solemnity
of public worship is increased by the
impression that it is the fervent and
simultaneous out-pouring of the hearts of a
whole united multitude; whilst in the Catholic
churches, except in the few minutes
occupied by the repetition of the mass, the
act of worship is individual and apart, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
performed almost by rote, at any hour of
the day, from sunrise to evening. The
parties, whom I shrunk from interrupting,
as we slipped past their little <i>prie dieu</i> chairs,
seemed to feel nothing whatever at the intrusion,
but raised their eyes for a moment
from their missals, to take a view of the
strangers and then returned to the point
where they had left off. This apparent indifference,
gives a bad impression of the
reality of their devotions; but still it was
not universal, and I have seen in the Roman
Catholic churches, numbers whose
whole soul seemed to be abstracted from all
that was passing around them in the deep
sincerity of their adorations.</p>

<p>In Antwerp, and, indeed, elsewhere, but
here we remarked it particularly, the vast
majority of the congregation were females,
who invariably seem to be the most devout.
I was particularly struck with a young
mother, apparently a lady of rank, and of
most interesting appearance, who walked
up the aisle of the Augustines, holding two
beautiful children by the hand, and kneeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
between them before the high altar,
repeated the vesper prayer along with them.
The innocent fervour of the children, as
with their little hands clasped and timid
eyes, they looked upwards at the splendour
of the altar, now lighted up for the evening
ceremony, and the modest devotion of their
gentle mother as she taught them to pray,
was a more exquisite picture than all the
gorgeous imaginings of Rubens, with which
we had been enchanted in the morning.</p>

<p>It was dark ere we could complete our
visit to the other churches of Antwerp,
which here, as elsewhere, are the great
depositories of the public treasures. We had
light, however, to see the exquisite pulpit in
the church of Saint Andrew. This is by far
the noblest work of this kind that I have
seen: it represents a boat drawn upon
the sea shore, beneath a rock on which
Christ stands, and calls to the fishermen
Simon, Peter and Andrew, “follow me, and
I will make you fishers of men; and
straightway they left their nets and followed
him.” Nothing could be more appropriate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
than the selection of this subject for such a
purpose, and in the church of Saint Andrew
too, and nothing of the kind can excel the extreme
beauty of its execution. The figures,
which are full of grace and expression, are
by Van Geel,—and the other parts and minute
details, are by Van Hoole, some of
which, such as the fish and nets in the
boat are as delicately finished as those of
Grynlyn Gibbons. Against one of the gothic
columns of this church, by the south transept,
there is a small portrait and an obscure
little monument in black and white
marble to the memory of Queen Mary of
Scotland, erected by two of her maids of
honour, “præ-nobilis familiæ <i>Currell</i>,” who
had attended her to the scaffold, and had
then returned to the Low Countries. Its inscription
records their indignation at her
fate, “seeking refuge in England where her
relative Elizabeth was Queen, she was, by
the perfidy of the parliament and the heretics,
held in captivity for nineteen years,
and then had her head cut off for the good
of religion. <i>Perfidia senat: et heret: post 19<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
captivit annos, relig: ergo caput obtruncata.</i>”</p>

<p>We dined with M. David, a wealthy merchant,
for whom we had brought a letter of
introduction; and if his house is to be
taken as a specimen of the rest, the merchants
of Antwerp must indeed be “princes.”
It occupied three sides of a large court-yard,
with lofty staircases on either side of the
porte-cochère, the rooms furnished with
English carpets, and the walls, as usual, covered
with some excellent pictures by native
artists. It is singular, that the use of carpets
should be so slow in making its way
upon the continent; climate is not the
cause, because in countries much colder
than England, they equally reject them with
the countries of the south. Independently
of their comfortable enjoyment, they are as
much a <i>picture</i> on the floor as stucco work
or frescoes are a picture for the ceiling.
We seem to divide the two with our continental
neighbours; with us the floors are
richly decorated, and the ceilings forgotten,
comparatively, whilst with them the ceiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
is the great field for the display of taste,
and the floors of ordinary houses are seldom
more costly than earthen tiles or
sanded fir. In their palaces, indeed, the
idea of an English floor is adopted, but it
is exhibited not in velvety carpets, but in
the more expensive material of an inlaid
<i>parquet</i>.</p>

<p>The Citadel of Antwerp is now little more
than a patch of ground encompassed by the
circuit of its fortified walls; the chapel and
the interior buildings, which once occupied
its centre, having been blown to dust by the
bombardment in 1830. The accounts which
an eye-witness gave us of some of the
scenes of this siege, were an admirable illustration
of the slight space that separates
the ridiculous from the sublime. The sensible
people of the city were, as I have before
mentioned, dreadfully opposed to the
revolution, and M. Rogier, and the other
leaders of the “<i>patrioterie Brabançonne</i>,”
having in vain essayed to persuade them
that they were the most suffering population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
in Europe, were about to give them
up as</p>

<p class="noin">when the victorious republicans resolved
to carry their arms to the gates of Antwerp,
and achieve its regeneration by assault and
storm. They accordingly invaded the city,
seven thousand strong, and sent a summons
to General Chassé to surrender. The
general, who had resided for years in the
city, was well aware of its loyalty, and had
likewise been inspired by the Prince of
Orange with a confident hope that the rebellion
would yet be stayed without bloodshed.
He looked on the martial display of
the “liberators” only as a riot which might
be quelled by the civil power, if it did
not sooner expire of itself, and he advised
the magistrates, as the best means to save
the city from being destroyed by artillery,
if he were compelled to repel them by force,
to assent to their entrance within the gates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
on an express understanding that they were
not to approach the citadel, or molest the
gun-boats in the river, and that they were
merely to hold quiet possession of the town
till the commandant should communicate
with the Hague. To save the property
within the walls from destruction, the magistrates
complied, and opened a negociation
with the commanders of the insurgent
force. The mortifying degradation of this
step, and the violence which it must have
been to the feelings of men of loyalty and
respectability, may easily be imagined when
it is known who these commanders were.
One was a Monsieur Mellinet, a French
officer, who had been compelled to abscond
in consequence of “a suspicion of debt”
and a conviction of bigamy. Another was
a M. Neillon, a Frenchman also and a private
soldier, but since a <i>major-general</i> in
the Belgian service. He had a short time
before been hissed off the stage at Antwerp,
when an actor at the theatre there. Like
General Vandamme, who, when a barber’s
boy at Ghent, had been whipped and banished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
for thieving, and vowed never to
return unless at the head of an army, <i>which
he lived to accomplish</i>; M. Neillon is said
to have launched a similar threat against
the audience of Antwerp, which he too had,
perhaps, sooner than he expected, the means
of putting in execution. The third was a
Monsieur Kepells, once an artillery man in
the Dutch service, but whose chief occupation
had been carrying the skeleton of a
whale round the country, the same which
was afterwards exhibited at Charing Cross
in London, and from its huge dimensions
acquired the title of “the Prince of Wales.”
It was to these three eminent commanders,
that the opulent merchants of Antwerp were
now compelled to surrender quiet possession
of their town. The negociation was concluded
by them in utter ignorance, however,
of the real strength of the insurgent army,
but when the gate was thrown open, and the
mob rushed into the city, the gentleman,
who was my informant, and had been an
eye-witness of their entry, declared that
their appearance baffled all description.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
They poured like a torrent of mud through
the gate, some with no shoes, some with
but one, some without hats or head-covering
of any kind, some few on horseback, others
dragging along two field pieces with ropes,
some with guns and swords, others with
bludgeons, but the vast majority with no
arms of any kind,</p>

<blockquote><p>
“Viribus confisus admirandisque lacertis!”
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">They instantly broke faith with the townspeople,
denied the right of the magistrates
to enter into any convention with the Dutch
commandant, an alien and a foreigner; and
proceeded forthwith to attack both the citadel
and the gun-boats, in which they had
an idea that there was money deposited,
in direct violation of their specific stipulations.
They assaulted the hospital attached
to the citadel, killed some four-and-twenty
poor invalids, and put the rest to flight
over the back wall into the citadel, when
old Chassé, reluctant to give credit to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
probability of their perfidy, believed it to
be some mistake, and gave them twenty
minutes to retire. But instead of following
his advice, they attacked the arsenal
in search of arms, upon which Chassé fired
a few guns from the ravelin in the hope
of dispersing them, and finally hauling
down the white flag, he opened the whole
thunder of the citadel, the forts and the
fleet in the harbour; he beat the arsenal
to the ground in a few minutes, and setting
fire to the great warehouses, known by the
name of the <i>entrepôt</i>, which was stored
full of merchandize—the whole were in a
few hours reduced to ashes and ruin. In
the meantime, the shot and shells which
were falling in the town were playing havoc
in all directions; the inhabitants fled in
terror, or hid themselves in the cellars; the
prison caught fire and disgorged its inmates,
and the whole city seemed threatened
with instant destruction; till the magistrates
having succeeded in reaching the
citadel, succeeded in appeasing the rage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
indignant commandant, and procured a renewal
of the truce. What a picture of the leaders,
the agents and the acts of a revolution!</p>

<p>The subsequent siege by the French in
1832, when the Dukes of Orleans and
Nemours “fleshed their swords” against
the Dutch, was something equally characteristic.
It inflicted no injury or danger
upon the town, being confined merely to
the citadel and the trenches around it, and
was rather regarded by the inhabitants as
a kind of grand military drama, which was
got up at the expense of Holland and
France for their amusement. The French,
in fact, did all in their power to contribute
to its theatrical effect. They had not
smelt powder since Waterloo, except across
their own barricades, and they were impatient
to make a grand display for the
recovery of their reputation. The operations
were conducted with all the pomp
and paraphernalia of a parade, and the
soldiers marched to work in the trenches
with colours flying and trumpets sounding.
In fact, so thoroughly melodramatic was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the whole affair, that seats on all the elevated
parts of the city were hired out to
view it, and the roof of the theatre itself,
being a suitable place, the play-bills announced,
“<i>the public is informed that places
may be procured at the Théâtre des Variétés
for seeing the siege!</i>”</p>

<p>With the exception of its churches, Antwerp
possesses no public buildings of any importance.
The Hôtel de Ville was, at one
time, a rival for any in the Netherlands, but
it was burned by the mutinous Spaniards of
the army of Requesens in the sixteenth century,
and the present edifice has nothing
very remarkable in its appearance. It is
situated in a curious little antique square,
surrounded by old Spanish houses, and
amongst the rest, one in which Charles V
was wont to lodge on the occasion of his
visit to the city. The <i>Exchange</i> is the
model from which that of London was constructed,
a square court-yard, surrounded
by arcades with groined arches, and supported
by truncated pillars in the Venetian
style, with rudely sculptured capitals. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
<i>Hanseatic House</i> is another huge mercantile
depôt which stands between the two basins
of Napoleon. It is of vast dimensions and
is visible from a considerable distance on
all sides of Antwerp. In an old tower near
the Marché de Poisson, we were told that
there were still to be seen the dungeons
which had been occupied by the Inquisition
during the reign of the Duke of Alva and
the “Council of Blood.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> started early this morning for St. Nicholas,
the central town of one of the most
important linen districts in Belgium, being
the great mart for the produce of the Pays
de Waes. Before leaving Antwerp, we
took another walk through its principal
squares and along the quay. The latter
which is of great length, stretching up the
banks of the Scheldt, is planted with tall
trees, and well finished in every respect.
These trees are trained in the nurseries of
the Low Countries, specially for the purpose
of planting in streets and squares. They
are regularly pruned, like standard fruit
trees for eight or ten years, till the stems,
have attained ten or fifteen feet in height
before they are removed, and having in the
mean time, been frequently transplanted to
render the roots fibrous and hardy, they are
placed in their intended position, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
scarcely any risk of failure or delay in the
renewal of their growth.</p>

<p>The Scheldt is here about the breadth
of the Mersey at Liverpool, and we crossed
it by a steam ferry, to the Tête de Flandres.
During the reign of Napoleon, this passage
was made by a flying bridge, one of those
ingenious contrivances, which are still seen
upon the Rhine, in which a line of boats,
attached to a large float, and sustaining the
length of the cable by which it is moored
in the centre of the river, are moved from
side to side across the stream, accordingly
as their heads and helms are adjusted, to
allow the force of the current to impinge
upon them. The river opposite Antwerp
is so deep, as to allow the largest vessels
to lie close along side the wharfs, but its
waters, from the nature of the soil they
traverse, are always yellow with sand and
mud, and rush past between the city and
the Tête de Flandres, with a rapidity that
anything but justifies Goldsmith’s title of
the “<i>lazy</i>” Scheldt.</p>

<p>In the river, nearly opposite the commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
basins, there occurred in 1831 an instance
of heroic devotion in a young officer
of the Dutch navy, for which it is rare to
find a parallel. He was a Lieutenant,
named Van Speyk, and in command of one
of the gun boats, which had guard upon
the citadel, whilst yet in the hands of the
Dutch. It was in the month of February,
and the little bark had been compelled to
seek shelter from the drifting ice, by running
into the harbour of Flushing. A storm,
however, drove her from her moorings, and
forced her on shore nearly opposite the city
of Antwerp. The efforts of the crew to
work her off were unavailing, and a crowd
of the revolutionary canaille were already
waiting on the quay, to secure the prize
and their prisoners, when the young commander
went below, and with the aid of one
companion opened the powder magazine,
gave his assistant a moment’s time to
plunge into the sea, and then applying his
match, blew up himself and thirty of his
sailors, rather than fall into the hands of
his enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>On landing at the Tête de Flandres, the
little fortress which commands the level
polder in front of Antwerp, we drove along
a causeway raised several feet above the
level of the plain. This vast alluvial district
was laid under water in 1832, during the
siege of Antwerp, and continued submerged
till 1835, when the water was again expelled;
but three years ago, the breach in
the dyke, which had been imperfectly repaired,
gave way during an extraordinary
tide, inundated the whole plain, and swept
away some thirty or forty peasants, who
were passing along the road to the market
of Antwerp. The view back upon the city
from this point is one of the finest imaginable,
all its bold and salient features coming
into one coup-d’œil; the river, the noble line
of quays, the citadel, the gigantic Hanseatic
depôt, and rising far into the sky, above
them all, the majestic and beautiful tower
of the Cathedral of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>The road passed through the little village
of Zwyndrecht, a secluded little spot embowered
in trees upon the verge of the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
polder. The income of the curate, a comfortable
and easy divine, who saluted us
from the roadside, is thirty pounds a year,
but the saint to whom the church is dedicated,
St. Makuyt, being in high repute for
the cure of weak limbs in children, brings
in a handsome income in addition. The
fame of the saint, is in fact, the main source
of income to the incumbents of these miserable
livings, many hundreds of which do
not exceed that of Zwyndrecht. The first
question of a priest, in fact, on being offered
a benefice, is, what is the stipend? the
second, who is the saint? The reason is
this, that the whole contents of Pandora’s
box, all the diseases of mankind have been
parcelled out to the various saints of the
calendar, each taking his or her own peculiar
department of the pharmacopœia:—thus,
Saint Blaize is consulted for the
quinsey, St. Nicholas for barrenness, St.
Apollonia for the tooth-ache, St. Dorothea
of Alois for pining children, St. Œdilia for
weak eyes, St. Cornelius for the hooping-cough,
St. Joseph au besoin for ladies who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
are anxious for heirs, St. Wendelin for the
murrain in cattle, and St. Gertrude to drive
away rats. Of all the most valuable and
money-making are the ladies who preside over
the illnesses of infants; not only the frequency
of the malady, but the alarm of the mother
contributing to the fame and the profits of
the saint. Not merely Roman Catholic ladies
who laugh at the powers ascribed to the
saint, but even protestants, who, in their
calmer moments, despise the imposture,
seldom fail in the last extremity to call in
the aid of the priest; they distrust the profession,
but they shrink from neglecting the
last expedient, however, unpromising. If
the patient sinks under the process, that
arises from the parent having been too long
in applying, and, if it revives, the faith of
the mother receives a powerful inclination
towards belief in the church.</p>

<p>Mons. D—— who was in the carriage
with us, mentioned rather an amusing
anecdote connected with the system. His
uncle is a priest and incumbent of a
parish, the patron saint of which, Saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Joachim has under his charge the department
of <i>deafness</i>. The income of his living
is small, but it is far more than exceeded by
the profits of the saint, who has been gradually
rising into repute during the last fifty
years that the old gentleman has had him
under his care. He came, however, a short
time since to visit his nephew at Antwerp,
and feelingly complained of a disaster, which
was likely to ruin both the saint and his
practice; he had completed his eightieth
year, and <i>had grown so deaf himself</i>, that
he could no longer make out the complaints
of his patients!</p>

<p>Beveren, a beautiful village, half way
between St. Nicholas and Antwerp, is the
residence almost exclusively of rich families
and retired citizens, most of whom are the
proprietors of the lands of the district.
Amongst them, one house was pointed out
as that of M. Borlut, a lineal descendant
of one of the leaders of Ghent, who distinguished
himself at the battle of the Golden
Spurs in 1302.</p>

<p>St. Nicholas, where we arrived for breakfast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
is a long straggling town, with an immense
market place, in which Napoleon
once reviewed a division of his army. The
prosperity of this little place is very remarkable
and arises altogether from the flourishing
condition of the flax trade. In 1788,
the population was but eight thousand, and
it is now upwards of eighteen. The country
around is one of the most populous in
the world, the inhabitants amounting, according
to the statistical account of M. Van
den Bogaerde, to no less than 5210 individuals
to a square league, of whom sixty
in every hundred are agriculturists, twenty-five
tradesmen, and fourteen live by other
means.</p>

<p>It was market day and the town crowded
by the peasantry, who were bringing in the
flax to the “deliveries” of the several
merchants, who attended from Ghent and
Antwerp. M. Cools, who is member of the
Chamber of Representatives for the district,
did us the favour to accompany us over the
town. The market place was filled with
stalls and booths of dress, hardware and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
furniture, great piles of wooden shoes,
were spread over the pavement, and amongst
the agricultural produce, was a profusion
of buck wheat (sarassin) which is made
into a sort of soft, sodden cake, by no
means unpalatable.</p>

<p>I was amused by a chorus of ballad
singers, who occupied a moveable stage in
the market, furnished with a large painted
scene, divided into compartments, each
representing some incident in the songs,
with which they favoured a very numerous
audience, who were grouped in great delight
around them. I bought the ballad which
was in Flemish, and contained three pieces,
two of them drinking songs, which were
illustrated in the scene above, by a party
seated in an estaminet. The song was an
eclogue in which two farmers, like Tytyrus
and Melibœus, complained of the pressure
of the times, Tytyrus professed to be so
poor, that he could no longer afford to pay
his barber, Melibœus assures him that bad
as their position is, it is no worse than it
was under Napoleon, and both join in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
refrain, that geneva is the only remedy
against all evils, political as well as personal.
The third was a metrical account of a girl,
called Joanna Scholtz, who had recently
been executed for murder, and the different
compartments of the scene, exhibited each
stage of the story from the innocence of the
heroine, to her exit at the guillotine. The
impression which this latter ditty made on
the nerves of the audience was prodigious,
as the female singer who took the chief
voice in it, with the energy, at least, if not
with the elegance of Malibran, proceeded
from verse to verse, pointing with a wand,
which she bore in her hand, to the
pictorial illustration of the story behind her.
This travelling orchestra with its waggon
and scenery, is surely very like Horace’s
account of the chorus, whence sprung the
drama in ancient Greece? By the way,
I was told by Count d’Haneal Ghent,
that there exists a copy of an original
comedy in Flemish, of a date much anterior
to any written drama, in any of the modern
languages of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>After breakfast we continued our drive
to Tamise or Thames, a manufacturing village
on the Scheldt, which with another
near it, called Waesminster, are said to
have been so named in honor of King
Edward III. At Thames we went over the
cotton factory of M. Talboom. It is on a
moderate scale, having about 6 to 7000
spindles, the machinery partly French, but
chiefly from the Phœnix works at Ghent.
The men and girls employed, work fourteen
hours a day, exclusive of two hours for
stoppages. We expressed our impression
of the severity of this, but were told, that it
was indispensable, in order to maintain their
position in the market. The proprietor,
who expressed the utmost alarm and dissatisfaction
at the state of the trade observed,
that if circumstances should enable the
English producers of cotton yarn, to reduce
their prices by a single figure, then those
of Belgium must abandon the manufacture,
which even, at present, was not paying its
own support. Like almost every other
branch of national industry, the cotton manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
which had attained a high degree
of prosperity during the union with Holland,
experienced an instantaneous reverse from
the events of the revolution. Factory after
factory closed its doors, some in ruin, others
to transfer their capital and industry to
Holland, whose extensive colonies afforded
that outlet for their produce, which they
could no longer find at home. The ministry
to check the downward career, resorted to
the absurd and childish expedient of purchasing
up the surplus production of the
manufacturers, in order to export it at a loss,
and thus get it out of the country and out
of the way, only to make room for fresh
accumulation of stock, and renewed adventures
by the government. In this way the
trade dragged on a fictitious existence, exposed
to peril by every fluctuation of the
markets of England, and from time to time
deluged by importations made at a moment
when it was necessary to get rid of a glut
in the market of that country or in France.
For the last two years, however, its condition
has been most precarious and threatening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
its consumers still further diminished
by the partition of the provinces of
Luxembourg and Limbourg with Holland,
and by an alteration in the cost of raw cotton,
and the unusual preference given to woollen
fabrics above those of cotton in almost every
country of Europe. In 1835, those interested
in the trade made an importunate
and alarming application to the government,
exposing the danger in which they found
themselves and imploring assistance; the
ministers were compelled to admit the urgency
of the case, to confess that their protection
was utterly inadequate, and to propose early
measures for their relief,—but the trade bitterly
complain, that up to the present hour,
nothing whatever has been attempted in
their behalf. <i>But in fact what has the
government in its power?</i> It cannot give
them that which is their only remedy, it cannot
conquer or force for them a market and
consumption proportionate to their means
of production. Year after year their exports
have been growing less and less since
1830. In 1833, according to a return in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
volume of M. Briavionne,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they exported <i>a
million</i> of kilogrammes of cotton goods; in
1834, <i>nine</i> hundred thousand; in 1835, <i>seven</i>;
in 1836, <i>six</i>; in 1837 upwards of <i>five</i>; in
1838 and 1839, upwards of <i>four</i>; a reduction
of sixty per cent. upon the trade in the short
period of six years! In the meantime, as the
Belgian spinners are inferior to the English
and French in the production of the finer
description of goods, the importations of
these direct, during the same period, have
suffered no material diminution, whilst their
introduction by smuggling and contraband,
is still carried on to an extent which M.
Briavionne states to be beyond calculation.</p>

<p>It is a matter to me utterly inexplicable,
that under such an aspect of affairs, the
number of power looms has been, nevertheless
increasing from year to year, and
Ghent has, at this moment, 2000 <i>more</i>
than it had in 1830. The fact is admitted,
and imperfectly accounted for in a memorial
presented this year to the legislature
from the cotton manufacturers of Belgium,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>who ascribe the increase to the expectation
that the government would speedily redeem
its pledge of 1835, and place the trade on
such a footing of protection and encouragement
as would restore to it that prosperity
in which it basked before the revolution
of 1830, and in the interim that it
was indispensible to make extraordinary
efforts in order to keep the trade alive
at all.</p>

<p>The document in which this passage
occurs is in every respect a very remarkable
one;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> it emanates from the entire
body of the trade in Belgium, not from
those of Ghent alone, where the revolution
is known to be unpopular, but those also of
Brussels where it originated, of Courtrai,
Renaix and St. Nicholas. It makes a
disclosure of the difficulties under which
the national commerce is suffering and their
causes; and suggests expedients for the remedy
in terms as frank as they are forcible.
After stating that in England, France, Germany
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>and America, the manufacture of cotton
has increased since 1829 from 50 to 75
per cent., they proceed to show that in the
same space of time, it has declined in Belgium
not only in profits but in actual
amount. “In Brussels,” they say, “at the
time of the revolution there were <i>four</i> factories
of the first class in full action: at
present there is but <i>one</i>, and even it has
ceased to work, and four minor establishments
have utterly disappeared within the
same space of time; the proprietors of such
as have not broken down by bankruptcy,
taking advantage of such accidents as the
burning of their mills to escape from the
trade, or withdrawing with their capital to
Holland. In the face of our country, with
our hands upon our hearts, we declare
solemnly that the cotton trade of Belgium
has been sinking continually since the
events of 1830; that it is verging to ruin,
and that its destruction is to be traced to
the neglect of the legislature to adopt an
effectual line of commercial policy for its
protection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>After disclaiming all implication of the
cotton trade in the over speculation and imprudences
which had ruined other branches
in the years preceding, they go on to say,
that “notwithstanding every circumspection
and expedient that, as prudent men,
they could adopt to make head against the
storm, they find themselves silently and
fatally undermined by an evil which they
have long foreseen, and against which they
have been guarding since the revolution
with less success than earnestness. <i>They
find themselves overwhelmed and crushed
“(dominés et écrasés)” by foreign competition.</i>
Their home market every day
wrested from them, and the little space
over which they can distribute the produce
of their industry, becoming every hour
more circumscribed and contracted. Only
look to the situation of the trade in Belgium,
and it will present to you something
remarkable, and at first inexplicable. The
Belgian possesses all the skill and ability of
his competitors; his position for commerce
is advantageous, and in some departments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the wages of labour, if not more favourable,
are at least equally so with those of other
countries; and notwithstanding all, we
are utterly unequal to contend with them,
and the struggle must inevitably be mortal
in the long run: “<i>la lutte nous deviendra
mortelle à la longue</i>.”</p>

<p>“But how can it be otherwise? We share
our own home markets with our rivals,
whilst they effectually exclude us from any
participation in theirs. Here is a constant
source of our weakness, our competitors
reaping advantages from our errors that
strengthen them to contend with ourselves.
The true economy of machinery and the
only means of selling cheaply is to sell
largely. But in Belgium the consumption
is the least conceivable, divided and attenuated
as it is by importations from abroad.
For printing calicoes, for example, the cost
of engraving a roller, is the same in France,
in England, and in Belgium, but from the
same roller, the English manufacturer has
a demand for five thousand pieces, the
French one for five hundred, and the Belgian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
but fifty. It is with impressions upon
cloth as with impressions upon paper—the
book, of which a prodigious number of
copies will be sold, can be offered at a price
little more than the cost of the paper, and
in like manner, the printed goods of England
and France can be sold for the bare
cost of the grey calico in Belgium.</p>

<p>But that which of all else inflicts the
most serious injury on the cotton trade of
Belgium, is her periodical inundation
with the surplus stock of her rivals,
which is poured from time to time into
her markets with instructions to force a
sale at any price, no matter how trifling.
Cottons, for which in the season of the
spring they asked three francs, are all
a few months later exported to Belgium,
and sold gladly for one franc and a half or
a franc and a quarter, thus bringing the
finest and most valuable muslins of France
into direct competition with the coarse
fabrics of Belgium. These injurious importations
take place at the commencement of
almost every season, the printers of France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
before they bring out their new designs,
making a clear sweep of the old, and carefully
avoiding to reduce their prices at
home, they force them into consumption
in Belgium, which affords the nearest and
most convenient market for the purpose.
The crises and commercial fluctuations
of other countries, thus become equally
ruinous with our own, but with this aggravation,
that prudence may guard against
the one, but no foresight or precautions
can suffice to ward off the other.”</p>

<p>Such is the situation of the home market—the
case of the export trade is equally
painfully depicted, and referred without
reserve or false delicacy to its genuine
cause. “The success of the foreign trade
in cotton,” continues the memorial, “must
have a certain support from the market at
home in order to enable the producer to
export with advantage, but this unfortunately
is the point in which of all others
Belgium is specially deficient. Her trade
had formerly an outlet in the Indian
possessions of the Netherlands, whose advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
were exclusively secured to her by
the privileges accorded to her flag.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> All
her surplus productions found here a vent
which was every day becoming more and
more important. Was there a superabundance
of produce at home, either from over
production amongst her own tradesmen,
or excessive imports from abroad, the merchant
could empty his warehouses into
Java, without the necessity of stopping his
machinery for a single hour. At the same
time, the market of Holland herself, with
two millions and a half of consumers, was
thrown open to her. Such were her peculiar
privileges <i>then</i>, but <i>now</i> the opening in
India is closed against her goods—Holland
takes continually less and less of her produce,
being supplied, like herself, with the
overstock of England and France—and we
have just suffered in the loss of Limbourg
and Luxembourg, a subtraction of 350,000
of our fellow subjects and customers. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>are the facts in all their truth, and one
path of safety alone lies open to us now,
the securing to us inviolate the possession
of our home consumption. This you can
effect for us only by compelling our foreign
competitors to retire from that position
which they have hitherto been permitted to
take up in our market by negligence, and
by putting an end to their frauds upon
the revenue. You must either be prepared
to do this, <i>or to annex us to some more extended
territory</i>, ‘ou vous nous adjoindrez
à un plus grand territoire.’</p>

<p>We call upon you then as our representatives
to take effectual steps for
securing to us our legitimate rights, that
is to say, the undisturbed enjoyment of the
only market that has been left to us, <i>or to
supply its place either by a commercial union
with France, or by an accession to the commercial
league of Germany</i>. We call upon
you to adopt these measures without farther
delay—our sufferings are keen and they
have been of long endurance—and, if in
spite of every effort to save us, you at last
discover its impossibility, we entreat of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
you, as a last favour, at least to say so
openly. We shall then avail ourselves of
such an announcement to shorten our
struggles, and to bring to a close sacrifices
and exertions that have swallowed up our
capital and our time. You, at least, may
obtain for us this, that our government
will tell us <i>what it means to do</i>. <i>Ten thousand
families</i> are hanging upon us for bread—fifty
thousand individuals, men, women
and children, spread over town and country,
and dispersed through every province, depend
upon our establishments for employment,
and when this fails, they have no
other resource to fly to. It remains with
you to preserve to Belgium a branch of her
industry which firm determination may yet
retrieve, and which only requires vigorous
resolution to free it from the tribute which
it now pays to the stranger.”</p>

<p>This importunate document produced,
as might have been anticipated no beneficial
result—the government have not the power
to aid them—their three propositions are
all alike beyond their reach;—to effectually
suppress smuggling from abroad would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
require a custom house police, which along
so vast a frontier and so extensive a coast,
would cost more than all the trade it would
protect could afford to pay;—and to gain
commercial advantages by a treaty with
France is as hopeless a suggestion, as the
proposal of a junction with the Prussian
league has proved impracticable and abortive.
The ultimate preservation of the cotton
trade of Belgium, in all its branches of
spinning, weaving and printing, seems to
me utterly hopeless by any ordinary policy,
and only to be achieved by a resort to
some expedient as yet untried.</p>

<p>From Tamise, we drove through a richly
planted country along the left bank of the
Scheldt to Dendermonde, or as it is called,
Termonde. This is a gloomy old town,
very silent and unattractive, with nothing
remarkable except its huge fortifications,
and these I am as unable to describe as my
Uncle Toby was, before he got his map,
to make his audience comprehend “the differences
and distinctions between the scarp
and counter-scarp—the glacis and the covered
way—the half-moon and the ravelin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p>Our associations with the name of Dendermonde
are all</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of vallies and retires, and trenches, tents,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of prisoners ransomed, and of soldiers slain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the currents of a heady fight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the great square, which is close by the
banks of the river, stands the Town Hall, a
flat looking building, and beside it, a news
room and saloon for balls, but all seemed to
be deserted, and we scarcely saw twenty persons
within the walls. A sight of it is sufficient
to satisfy one of the practicability of
the expedient resorted to by Vendome, in
1706, when defending the town against
the Duke of Marlborough, (or rather his
brother, who conducted the siege) of laying
the country under water up to the walls of
the town. By a singular coincidence, however,
the expedient proved unsuccessful,
as the waters of the Scheldt fell so low as to
reduce the floods on the lowlands to a
fordable depth. The Duke, in his letter
to Lord Godolphin, says: “Dendermonde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
could never have been taken but by the
hand of God, which gave us seven weeks
without rain. The rain began the very
next day after we had possession, and continued
till the evening. I believe the King
of France will be a good deal surprised,
when he shall have heard that the garrison
has been obliged to surrender themselves
prisoners of war, for upon being told
that the preparations were making for the
siege, he said: '<i>they must have an army of
ducks to take Dendermonde</i>.’”</p>

<p>Teniers lived in Dendermonde, of which
his lady was a native, and the house he occupied,
with a fresco over the mantel-piece of
the saloon, is still shown to visitors. It has
some manufactories of cotton and wool, but
the only process we saw was one of those
mills for crushing oil, which as they
find both the raw material and the consumer
upon the spot, seems to be amongst
the most prosperous establishments in Belgium.</p>

<p>The journey by the railroad from Dendermonde
to Mechlin, a distance of sixteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
miles, is performed in about half-an-hour.
Mechlin quite comes up to one’s expectations
of it. I had always heard of it by its
soubriquet of <i>Malines la Propre</i>, and associated
it with the stateliness and quaintness
of “Mechlin lace:” and certainly it is just
such an old place as one would imagine
likely to produce such collars and lappets
as one sees in Vandyke’s portraits—quiet,
grotesque-looking old houses of great size,
and with rich and sober ornaments and
decorations to the points and gables, tall
gothic churches, and streets accurately
clean, with groups of cheerful, contented-looking
loungers at the doors, and here
and there a demure ecclesiastic, stepping
silently along in his black gown
and silk sash, with his little three-cornered
hat and white bands, edged with black
ribband, and broad silver buckles to his
shoes.</p>

<p>Mechlin is full of priests, as it abounds
in churches, and is the residence of an
Archbishop. The present prelate is M.
Sterckx, son to a farmer at the village of
Ophem, but one of the most restless, energetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and ambitious ecclesiastics that ever
aspired to political power. He obtained
his present See subsequently to the Revolution,
but he is now the leading spirit of
the <i>parti-prêtre</i> in the legislature, and his
will and wishes, transmitted through becoming
channels, serve to “move, direct,
and animate the whole” policy of the state,
in the present ascendant position of the
church in both houses. The Abbé de Pradt
was Bishop of Mechlin under Napoleon.</p>

<p>Malines is a very antique place; its
name has been derived from <i>Maris linea</i>, and
the influence of the tide upon the current
of the Scheldt, and its tributary, the Dyle,
on the side of which it is built, is felt for a
mile beyond the town. It was once fortified,
and besieged by Marlborough and
others, but the French levelled the
ramparts and filled up the fosse in
1804. Its lace manufacture has been
sadly interfered with by other competitors,
but above all, by the invention of tulle and
bobbin-net, but the genuine specimens of
its ancient production are still in the most
distinguished repute. The other occupations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of the population, which is somewhere
about 20,000, are the manufactures of cashmere
shawls, and chairs of gilded leather,
which were, at one time, an article of export,
so choice was the taste of their
designs; they still engage upwards of four
hundred workmen, and are in as great
repute as ever with the Dutch. The district
around is as usual, highly agricultural,
and the canals which traverse it and
pass by the city, have rendered Mechlin a
prosperous seat of the flax trade, and quite
an entrepôt for corn and oil.</p>

<p>The only objects of interest, and depositaries
of art in Mechlin, are, as usual, the
churches. The Cathedral, whose solid moresco
tower is seen from a vast distance, is
of great antiquity, though not remarkable
for its beauty. The tower is of amazing
height, though unfinished; we ascended it
by a stone staircase, in which I lost count
after reckoning an ascent of five hundred
steps; I should, therefore, conclude it to
be at least three hundred feet high. It
contains one of those “corals for grown
gentlemen,” as some Fadladeen in music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
has denominated the carillons of the
Netherlands—a chime of innumerable stops,
set in motion by machinery. But, I confess,
that the well arranged harmony of the
carillons is to me infinitely more pleasing
than the monotonous clangour that on fête
days in London, disturb the city from its
propriety, or the sweet but “drowsy tinklings”
from every church and convent,
that load the air with sound on an evening
in Italy. Their gay and measured melody
sometimes strikes so unexpectedly upon
the ear, descending through such a distance
from the sky, that it, also, seems like the
song of Ariel attracting Ferdinand:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where should this music be? i’ the air or i’ the earth?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is no mortal business, nor no sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the earth owes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It swept by me upon the waters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Allaying both their fury and my passion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With its sweet air.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Some of the city bells, in another chamber
above, are of inconceivable size, one of them
being 15,000 pounds in weight. Whilst
we were in the room, two of the Mechlin
“youths” came in to ring the peal, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
always sounds before sunset; and although
the one they selected was the third or fourth
in point of size, and they set it in motion
by means of a lever, worked with the foot,
it occupied from seven to ten minutes before
they succeeded in producing an oscillation
so great as to make the tongue of the
bell strike the sides. On the outside of the
tower, at this height, is a dial for the clock;
a circle, the same size of which, is designed
in small stones upon the pavement of the
square below, connected, I think, with a
sun-dial; I paced it and found it upwards
of forty feet in diameter, although its counterpart
on the tower looks to be of the ordinary
size, such is its extreme elevation.
The guide who conducted us to the top,
pointed out a balcony from which a watchman,
who is always stationed aloft to look
out for fires, fell, a short time ago; he was
taken up below, as our informant said, “as
soft as a pack of wool.” The tower and
its bells are a distinct and separate erection
from the church, although united to it, and
belong to the corporation of the city—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
remnant of the olden time, when every free
city had its “belfry.” This corporation
seems still to have absolute power within
their bailiwick, and not to exercise it
with due “discretion,” they prevented
the passage of a canal, from Louvain
through their streets, which would have
been of most signal advantage to their
trade; and, more recently, they stoutly and
successfully resisted the government in
bringing the central depôt of the railroads
within the circuit of the city, instead of
fixing it, as they have been compelled to
do, at some distance beyond its boundary—a
circumstance which they now sensibly
regret.</p>

<p>The church itself is dedicated to St. Romoald,
whose body, enclosed in a suitable
shrine, is deposited upon the high altar.
In the choir, a chapter of the Golden Fleece
was held in 1491, at which Henry VII of
England was invested with the insignia of
the order. In the curtain wall of the
choir, to the left of the altar, there is rather
an interesting monument of the family of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the Bertholdi, a powerful house, who in
the thirteenth century, having been entrusted
with the office of “Protector” of
Malines, by the Prince Bishop of Liege, to
whose dominion it was attached, succeeded
in making themselves independent of their
Sovereign, and for some generations, held
absolute authority as Lords of Malines.
The inscription on their tomb is quaint and
poetical:—“<i>Trium Betholdorum, qui sæculo
decimo tertio Mechliniæ dominarunt hic ultima
domus.</i>” There are numbers of other marble
monuments of ancient Archbishops and
prelates of Mechlin, but none of them so
interesting as this.</p>

<p>There is a curious series of old paintings,
illustrative of the actions of St. Romoald,
which are attributed to Van Eyck, and are,
at all events, referable to his period and
school; an inscription relates, that in the
sixteenth century they were hidden, to
elude the fury of the Iconoclasts; and
another records their second removal in
1794 or 5, “tempore perturbationis Gallorum,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to escape the equally formidable
insanity of the French revolutionists.</p>

<p>This church has, also, a magnificent picture
of the Crucifixion by Vandyke; but,
however astonishing in its vigorous excellence,
and in the conception of its individual
parts, its comparison, as a whole,
with that of Rubens’ Descent from the
Cross, or his painting of the same subject
in the Museum at Antwerp, will sufficiently
exhibit the superiority of the latter in the
art of composition. Like a perfect drama,
into which no character is admitted, that
does not contribute to heighten the denouement,
there is no figure or expression in
Rubens’ picture, that has not an immediate
reference to the main action of the moment,
and that does not conspire to concentrate all
the interest in one simultaneous movement.
In Vandyke’s Crucifixion, however, the three
crosses form three distinct episodes, each
tells a separate story, and thus divides the
interest of the subject, instead of working it
up into one overpowering sensation, as Rubens
does. But, on the other hand, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
splendid picture exhibits all Vandyke’s masterly
powers of individuality and detail,
every figure is a study, and above all, the
beautiful Magdalene at the foot of the Cross,
is one of the most lovely conceptions that
has ever been embodied upon canvass. Sir
Joshua Reynolds says “this may be justly
considered one of the first pictures in the
world, and gives the highest idea of the
genius of Vandyke.” The agony of the
dying thief may be strongly suspected of
being suggested by Rubens. The Cathedral
possesses one of the very finest carved pulpits
in the Netherlands, representing the
conversion of St. Paul, in which the terror
of the horse, and the fall of the rider, are
exhibited with the most surprising vigour
and effect.</p>

<p>In another church, that of Notre Dame,
there is a picture by Rubens of the miraculous
draught of fishes, which with its volets
once formed eight subjects, which he painted
in ten days for the chapel of the Poissonniers.
The entire were carried to Paris, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
only five returned. Another of his favourite
pictures is the Adoration of the Magi, in
the church of St. John, of which he used to
say, “c’est à Saint. Jean de Malines, qu’il
faut aller pour voir de mes beaux ouvrages.”
I must say, however, that it did not afford
me the same pleasure, which it must have
done to the great painter himself. The
sacristan showed us an autograph receipt of
Rubens for 1800 florins, for this picture
and its volets, all of which he painted in
eighteen days. It bears date in March,
1624. The altar of the church was likewise
designed by him, and the walls are covered
with a profusion of paintings, the works of
artists of minor eminence, and whose merits,
though they would be recognized elsewhere,
are unfavourably brought into contrast with
those of their great master.</p>

<p>We dined at one of the most comfortable
and clean hotels I have seen in Belgium,
that of St. Jacques, in the Marché aux
Grains, and returned, by the railroad, to a
very inferior one at Brussels, though much
more pretending.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> route from Mechlin to Louvain,
which we passed this morning, is the first
of the line of railroads on which we have
perceived any striking inequality of surface;
numerous cuttings and embankments occurring
as it approaches the latter town. Beyond
it the alluvial and sandy plains disappear,
and the country assumes the usual
hilly and diversified appearance, so much
so, that before arriving at Tirlemont, it
passes under a tunnel of nearly a thousand
yards in length. The scenery, too, along
the banks of the Dyle, is most rich and diversified,
Louvain, itself, being seated on
the skirts of a forest, which has evidently
been a portion of that of Soigné, at some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
distant period. Fuel must be here pretty
abundant, not only wood being plentiful,
and coal at no great distance, but, in the
sunk land, I observed a stratum of turf,
under the sandy surface, which had been
worked in large quantities, and stacked
along the side of the road.</p>

<p>Belgium, from its geographical position,
not less than the extraordinary adaptation
of the nature of the surface, seems to have
invited the experiment of supplanting the
old modes of conveyance, by an uniform and
comprehensive system of railroads. The
project was taken up by the government in
1833, and the plan finally executed, was
that of taking one point, in the centre of
the kingdom, and issuing from it—north,
west, east, and south—lines, to maintain a
communication with the sea-ports of Ostend
and Antwerp, and the great commercial
outlets of France and Prussia. It is
expected, that on reaching the frontier of
these two states, at Limbourg and Couvin,
in the Bois de la Thierache, the enterprize
would be taken up by private speculators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
who would continue the chain to Cologne,
on the east, and, on the south, in the direction
of Paris. The whole project is in direct
opposition to the <i>laissez faire</i> principle
of the English government, whose maxim
is, to leave everything to private enterprize,
that private capital is calculated to grapple
with. But Belgium has been so long accustomed,
both under France and Holland,
to “government interference” in the minutest
concerns of the nation, even to the prejudice
or supersession of individual speculation,
that the habitual policy of the country
may have rendered its intervention indispensible.
And as the entire extent of all
the lines projected, in progress, and open,
will not exceed three hundred miles, and
these can be completed, at a cost infinitely
lower than anything that has yet been attempted
in Great Britain, the undertaking
is not so very gigantic as at first sight it
might appear. One advantage which arises
from this undertaking, is that its benefits
will thus be extended equally to every portion
of the kingdom; had it been left solely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to private enterprise, those lines alone would
have been selected, which promised to be the
most prolific in profits; and other districts,
less inviting, would never have been traversed
by a railroad at all. But the government,
by combining the entire into one
comprehensive system, is enabled to apply
the excess of gain on one section, to repair
the possible loss upon another, and thus extend
its facilities alike to all. But private
enterprise is by no means prohibited, and
in addition to the government works, applications
from capitalists have been already
granted, to construct branches in the mining
districts of Hainault.</p>

<p>The average cost of those already completed
scarcely exceeds £8,500 a mile,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
including carriages and buildings. The
most expensive line was that from Louvain
to Tirlemont, which, including the tunnel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>I have mentioned, cost £11,661 a mile, and
the cheapest, that from Dendermonde to
Mechlin, which, as the level surface of the
ground had barely to be disturbed for laying
down the rails, cost only £4,583. This,
however, is for single lines of rails; that
alone from Brussels to Antwerp being yet
laid with double, though all have been
constructed with a view to their ultimate
adoption. The line now in progress from
Liege to Verviers, passing, as it does,
through a most unequal and hilly country
in the vicinity of the Vesdre, will, I imagine,
from the numerous embankments and cuttings
through rocks, be the most costly yet
attempted. The natural facility of the
ground, and the consequent simplicity of
the work, led to one result very different
from our experience in England;—the actual
costs of the works, even on the most difficult
sections, have not exceeded the estimates
by more than eight per cent.</p>

<p>In England, the least expensive line yet
opened has cost £10,000 a mile, (in Ireland
one has been completed, from Belfast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Lisburn, for less than £7000), but others
have cost upwards of £40,000; and the
average of forty-five lines, for which bills
were passed in 1836 and 1837, was upwards
of £17,500 a mile <i>on the estimate</i>, which
may have fallen much below the actual
outlay subsequently. But, besides the
mere facilities of the country; other causes
have contributed to render the expenses in
Belgium infinitely lower than those of Great
Britain; in the former, there were no committees
of the House of Commons to enable
the solicitors’ bills to mount to 70 and
£80,000 for expenses of obtaining an act,
as was the case on the instances of the
London and Birmingham line, and that of
the Great Western; nor were there rich
demesnes and parks to be preserved, whose
proprietors were to receive the <i>prætium
affectionis</i> in compensation for the damages;
nor towns to be entered in search of termini,
where whole streets of houses and acres of
building ground were to be purchased up, at
an expense that would prove ruinous to any
but the joint-stock capital of a railroad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Their engineers too were enabled to avoid
the expense, whilst they profited by the success
of the experiments in every stage which
were making in England—experiments which
were even more costly when they failed.</p>

<p>The fares by the Belgian trains are, from all
these circumstances, reducible to a sum much
below the cheapest rate of railroad travelling
in England; in their first-class conveyances
“Berlins” (which were equivalent to the
“mail carriages” on our lines, but are now
withdrawn), the fare from Antwerp to Brussels
was only <i>two shillings and eleven-pence</i>,
whilst for the same distance, thirty miles,
it was <i>six shillings and six-pence</i> from Manchester
to Liverpool. In their present, most
expensive carriages, the “diligences,” the
charge is <i>two shillings and six-pence</i>, whilst
those in England are <i>five and six-pence</i>—and
in their “chars-a-banc” or second-class, <i>one
shilling and eight-pence</i>, whilst ours are <i>four
shillings</i>—they have also an inferior trainstill,
“the waggons” for which we have no equivalent,
that carry passengers for <i>a shilling</i>. As
these rates are something about one-half the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
old fares by the conveyances which railroads
have superseded, the increase of intercourse
has been augmented in a ratio
that almost exceeds credibility. The number
of passengers between Antwerp and
Brussels before 1836, was estimated at about
8000 annually, but since the opening of the
road throughout, in that year, they
amounted in 1837 to 781,250, and though
the numbers diminished, as the attraction of
novelty wore off, in 1838 they still exhibited
an increase of from five to six hundred per
cent over the old mode of travelling.</p>

<p>The rate of travelling does not exceed
twenty-six miles an hour, and in general
does not average more than twenty; and
by the statement of M. Nothomb, the
minister for public works, of the number
of accidents there appears to have been
but one man wounded in 1835, one in
1836, five in 1837, twelve in 1838, and
seven in the six months to June 1839, when
the return was made up. All of these
catastrophes are ascribed by the minister to
the wilfulness or imprudence of the parties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
themselves, “no possible blame being attachable
to any officer of the company.”
One man was drunk, and another was deaf,
a third would persist in riding on the balustrade
of the waggon, and a fourth stood
upright in passing a viaduct, several were
killed in looking after their hats; and one
formidable accident alone admits of censure
upon the officials, when a train returning
at night, after leaving King Leopold at
Ostend, went by accident into the Lys,
near Ghent, the guardian of a drawbridge,
which had been opened to allow a lighter
to pass, having gone to drink in an adjoining
cabaret, without taking the trouble to
close it! The engine actually cleared the
gulf by its velocity, but was dragged back
into the river by the weight of the train,
and the engineer and his assistant killed
upon the spot.”</p>

<p>As yet M. Briavionne remarks in his
work, “<i>De l’Industrie en Belgique</i>,” the
receipts of the railroads are below the calculations
of these projectors; but this is
hoped to be remedied in time by a diminished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
expenditure in management and repairs;
and, perhaps, by an increase in the tarif
of fares, which are felt to be lower than is
equitable to the interests of the undertaking.
Sixty-eight out of every one hundred passengers
availing themselves of the very
cheapest conveyance, the “<i>waggons</i>,” instead
of a fair proportion, as had been
anticipated, travelling by the first and
second class carriages. The enterprise, he
conceives to have been unwisely expanded
into the present stupendous system, when the
original idea of effecting a rapid communication
with Germany across Belgium, independent
of Holland, would have achieved
the grand object aimed at, with a less expense.
This was a sacrifice of solid advantages to
ostentation, and has been followed by financial
disappointment; but it arose in some
degree, from the national desire to give independent
Belgium an important prestige
in the eyes of Europe. “The <i>Chemin de Fer</i>
is then the more popular in Belgium, adds
M. B., because the people can see the intimate
connexion between its construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and the events of 1830; <i>without the revolution,
we should have had no railroad, and
without the railroad we should have been
better without the revolution</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Louvain, the Oxford, or rather the <i>Maynooth</i>
of Belgium is a miserable, dilapidated
old town, with narrow streets and an air
of dirt and desolation. Four hundred years
ago, it was a place of wealth and importance,
the capital of the ancient duchy
of Brabant, and the residence of its sovereigns
before its incorporation with the
territory of Burgundy. Justus Lipsius,
himself a citizen of Louvain, and born in a
little hamlet between it and Brussels, records,
on the authority of some old tradition,
that in 1360 there were within the
walls from 3,000 to 4,000 cloth workers,
who gave employment to 150,000 artizans,
(an evident exaggeration in amount, that
attests, however, the fame of its past prosperity),
and the story adds, that at the
hours of meals, the great bell of St. Peter’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>was sounded to warn parents to keep their
children within doors, lest they should be
crushed and trampled by the crowds who
were passing from their workshops to their
homes! At present, its manufactures are
at an end, with the exception of its beer,
whose fame is known throughout the Netherlands,
its population is dwindled to
25,000, and even within the circuit of the
walls, large spaces covered with buildings
are now converted into fields or cultivated
as market gardens for the supply of the
citizens.</p>

<p>In later times, the name of Louvain was
familiar throughout the Roman Catholic
world, from the renown of its university,
which had existed since the year 1426, and
was long one of the most eminent seminaries
of theological learning in the west
of Europe. It contained in the last century
no less than forty-three colleges, distributed
over the various quarters of the
city, and was frequented by upwards of
8,000 students in humanity and divinity,
who obtained, at various times, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
emperors extraordinary privileges, exemption
from taxes, freedom from arrest, freedom
of the city and presentation to the
most valuable livings. The bishops of the
Pays Bas were ordinarily chosen from the
fellows of Louvain; numbers of its members
attained the dignity of a cardinal’s
hat, and one the Pontificate itself, under
the title of Adrian VI. Charles V and his
sisters were educated at Louvain. The
power and the influence which it enjoyed,
however, were not tempered by due discretion,
and its houses assuming a right of
political interference in opposition to the
government, were suppressed and dispersed
by the Emperor Joseph II. Under the
dominion of France, the university was
never restored, as its funds were required
for other purposes, but in 1816, the King
of Holland, as a measure of conciliation to
his Roman Catholic subjects, revived its
charter and re-opened its schools.</p>

<p>The principal building, “the Halle” of
the university, is situated behind the Hôtel
de Ville in the rue de Namur. Some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the minor colleges have been thrown down
or converted into hotels, warehouses, hospitals
and barracks. Others are still used
as the lecture rooms and theatres of the
revived university. The <i>Collège des Prédicateurs
Irlandais</i>, founded in 1697 by Cardinal
Howard, is no longer in existence.
Since the revolution of 1830, the University
of Louvain has been again remodelled,
and its name altered to that of <i>l’Université
Catholique</i>, to distinguish it from that of
Brussels, which is known as <i>l’Université
Libre</i>.</p>

<p>“La bière de Louvain,” is to be found
in every hotel and estaminet in Belgium.
We went over one of the largest breweries,
that of Messrs. Renier, Hambrouk and Co.,
the Barclay and Perkins of Belgium. It
is but recently built, and being an entirely
new building from the foundation, its arrangements
are the most commodious and
compact imaginable; it is calculated to
brew two hundred barrels a-day, and is now
in full work; its usual stock is 14,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
barrels. The machinery had been constructed
by Sir John Rennie, of London,
but has since been increased. I found here
the same preference for high pressure steam
engines which seems so universal in Belgium,
the one erected was a low pressure
one, very much to the regret of one
of the proprietors, M. Behr, who conducted
us over the establishment. The apparatus
exhibited all the recent English improvements,
but what is, I think, considered
dangerous in England, they had a large
copper cooler in use. Their boilers were
constructed with one cylinder within
another, to avoid burning in the process,
a precaution which is rendered necessary
from the quantity of wheat flour used for
their favourite and peculiar “white beer.”</p>

<p>The malt which was on the floors had
been allowed to germinate much longer
than in England, in fact, till a shoot of half
an inch to an inch long had issued from
each grain. By this means, the saccharine
matter is intentionally so exhausted, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the beer has but little or no flavour of it.
The name of their ordinary beer is Peetermans,
(from an ancient military corps of
Louvain, which had existed since the
thirteenth century), and the finer is the <i>bière
blanche</i>, which is consumed at a distance in
large quantities. An Englishman would not
let either enter his lips, they are both as thin
as water and as sour as verjuice, and yet
the quantities consumed everywhere in Belgium
is quite surprising. The annual consumption,
calculated upon the excise duty
paid upon beer, which is upwards of seven
millions of francs per annum, and is collected
in the proportion of one franc and a
half for every hectolitre, or twenty-six gallons,
amounts to 5,400,000 hectolitres, or
something above four millions of barrels,
<i>being about thirty-five gallons per annum for
every individual of the population</i>! A
small quantity only, not exceeding 40,000
gallons, is for foreign export. The usual
price is about twelve francs a hectolitre,
from which some idea may be formed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the “thin potations” in which the Belgian
peasant delights.</p>

<p>The operation of making this light beer
is amazingly quick, the malt is mashed
one day, brewed and cooled the next, fermented
for forty-eight hours, and drunk
the fourth morning. That for immediate
use is fermented in the barrel <i>on its end</i>,
a practice unusual in this country, but which
M. Behr conceived advantageous. A chime,
rather deeper than usual, served to retain
on the top, the barm and the liquid
forced up by the expansion of the fermentation,
which, as the process declined,
retired again to its place, thus keeping
constantly an ascending and descending
current, which facilitated the operation,
beside being more cleanly and costing less
labour. Every different district in Belgium
produces a different kind of beer, which,
curiously enough, cannot be successfully
imitated by the others, thus the brewers
of Brussels have not succeeded in producing
the <i>uytzet</i> of Ghent, nor those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Ghent the yellow <i>faro</i> which is the favourite
beverage of Brussels, whilst both
have failed to rival the “white beer” of
Louvain.</p>

<p>The great lion of Louvain is its Town
Hall, which is certainly the most surprisingly
rich specimen of gothic architecture
in the world. It is literally covered
with most elaborate and intricate carvings
from the foundation to the roof. Charles V
spoke of placing the Cathedral of Antwerp
under a glass shade, but actually one
is inclined to wish for something of the
kind to keep the dust from discolouring
the florid tracery of the Hôtel de Ville at
Louvain. It is situated in a little ancient
square in which Marshal Villeroy held a
council of war by torch-light on the night
of the Battle of Ramilies, in 1706. The
building itself, which is of the fifteenth
century, is small, but its proportions and
ornaments are of the most delicate elegance.
It has no tower, but the heaviness of its
lofty roof is relieved by turrets at the
corners. The whole front is covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
bas-reliefs, representing the history of and
the destruction of the Cities of the Plain,
with more fidelity than is reconcileable to
modern taste. The whole has for many
years been undergoing a thorough restoration,
which is now complete, every decayed
piece of stone being accurately replaced
by a fac-simile of the original carved
work. The interior is not suitable to the
beauty of the outside, and an old hall on
the third story is fitted up as a gallery,
with a wretched collection of pictures,
which are libellously ascribed to the old
masters. There is, however, a gallery in
Louvain of high repute, that of M. Vanderschreick,
which contains a number
of superb paintings of the Dutch school,
Rubens, Teniers, Vandyke, Rembrandt,
and, in short, a specimen of all its best
masters. It is accessible to strangers, and
since the dispersion of M. Schamp’s pictures
at Ghent, is, perhaps, the best collection
in Belgium.</p>

<p>The churches in Louvain, notwithstanding
the long presence of so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
luminaries of the establishment, are not eminent
for either their riches or their beauty.
The Collegiate Church of St. Pierre, which
is the principal one, has a superbly carved
pulpit by Berger of great height—a rock
crowned with trees, and at its foot, St.
Peter on one side denying Christ, and at
the other, Saul struck from his horse on
his way to persecute the Christians of
Damascus. A little chapel at the back of
the altar is dedicated to St. Margaret, the
saint of maid-servants, and is connected
with a curious little legend illustrative of
the times. <i>Margrietje</i> was the domestic of
an old couple, who kept an hostelry for
pilgrims in the year 1225, at Louvain. Her
master and his wife had resolved to retire
from the world, and had converted all their
property into money, with which they were
about to retire into the monastery of St. Bernard.
On the eve of their putting this plan
into execution, however, some miscreants
formed a conspiracy to assassinate them,
and, disguising themselves as pilgrims,
came late in the evening to seek for shelter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
at the accustomed inn. The good old
people anxious to perform their last act of
charity, sent Margaret to bring wine in a
wooden bottle, still preserved in the church.
The pretended pilgrims then strangled their
hosts, and on Margaret’s return, she shared
a similar fate. Her body, however, which
they carried out and precipitated into the
Dyle, instead of sinking in the river, floated
back against the stream crowned with an
aureole, and the ripple of the water making
sweet music as it bore her along. The
Duke and Duchess of Brabant astonished
at the miracle, caused a chapel to be built
for her remains at the back of the great
church of St. Pierre, where her body was
embalmed and enclosed in a gilded shrine.
The fame and the fidelity of the interesting
saint attracted crowds of devotees to her
tomb, and in time the door upon the street
was closed, and another opened from the
church, where the chapel and the altar of
Margrietje are still the favourite resort of
the serving maidens of Brabant.</p>

<p>The church of Saint Michel, which once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
belonged to the order of the Jesuits, was
one of the most sumptuous in the city: it
has, however, been dismantled of all its
ornaments, and its superbly carved pulpit
was removed by Maria Theresa to the
Church of St. Gudule at Brussels. During
the reign of the French republic, St.
Michel’s was converted into the Temple of
Reason for the district, and the statue of
the Saviour was removed from the altar to
make room for the Goddess of Liberty.
The tomb of Justus Lipsius in the old
ruined convent of the Recollets, with its
sententious inscription written by himself,
is a curious illustration of “the pride that
apes humility.”</p>

<p>Lipsius, as a scholar, was the rival of
Scaliger; he was successively a Roman
Catholic, a Lutheran, and a reformed Protestant,
and after publishing an exhortation
to persecution, died in 1606, in the bosom
of Rome with “<i>ure et seca!</i>” upon his lips.
Strange that the same spirit which could
prescribe fire and faggots for its fellow-men,
should have lavished all its fondness
upon flowers and favourite dogs, whom
Lipsius has immortalized in his odes and
epitaphs! Rubens has introduced the portrait
of Lipsius into his picture of the philosophers
along with that of Hugo Grotius,
Rubens himself and his brother, with his
faithful Saphir fawning at his knee, and
behind him a <i>tulip</i>, emblematic of his love
for flowers, placed beside a bust of Cicero;
his comments upon whom, written at the
age of nineteen, introduced Lipsius to the
notice and patronage of the Cardinal Granvelle.</p>

<p>It was at Louvain that the Belgian
troops, under their new King, achieved, in
1832, their ludicrous flight before the
Prince of Orange, which fully vindicated for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
them the soubriquet of the “Braves Belges,”
which they had acquired years before by
their cowardly pusillanimity at Quatre Bras
and Waterloo. A few days before the affair
at Louvain, they had made a similar pitiful
exhibition at Hasselt, where they fled in
terror on the approach of the Dutch, and
yet two years before, the Dutch were utterly
unable to make head against the Belgians,
either at Brussels, Ghent, or Antwerp! The
bravery of the Belgians is, indeed, become
a past tradition. Cæsar accords them credit
of being the most gallant soldiers, whom
he encountered in Gaul, “<i>horum omnium
fortissimi sunt Belgæ</i>,” and Florus ascribes to
them the honour of turning the fortune of
the day at Pharsalia. These titles they have
long since, however, resigned; the last fire
of their gallantry seems to have burned out
under the Arteveldes and John Hyoens, in
the wars of the “Fullers and Weavers;” for
in the troubles of the Spanish persecution,
the military renown of the patriots belongs
almost exclusively to the soldiers of “Father
William,” as the Prince of Orange is still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
affectionately styled. The Flemings were
anxious enough, in the first instance, to
fly to arms when the Duke of Alva was
wringing from them his iniquitous taxes,
but so soon as these were repealed, they
were quite contented to leave the Dutch
all the glory of their liberation. Years of
repose and peace under Austria, and an
addiction to agriculture and commerce, appear
to have effaced even the recollection of
their former valour; they were utterly incapable,
even if they had been inclined to
resist the progress of the French in 1794;
and the whole series of the exploits of the
Belgian soldiers from Quatre Bras to Hasselt
and Louvain, with the single exception
of the affair of 1830 at Brussels, is but a
succession of laughable scampers, almost
before coming within the range of a shot.</p>

<p>In appearance, the soldiery, whom we
saw at Ghent, Brussels, and elsewhere,
are awkward and diminutive little fellows,
such as one could hardly see cased in uniform,
on which the tailors have evidently
worked by guess, without creating a smile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
even without the inseparable association of
the <i>braves Belges</i>, which recurs to one’s
mind every time they pass. The officers,
who are always lounging about the railroad
stations, are much the same, and with
their savage mustachios, fierce black locks,
and breasts padded out till they look like
pouter pigeons, they strongly remind us of
the military air of the riding-master at
Astley’s.</p>

<p>Having come by the railroad to Louvain,
we hired a calèche to return across the
country to Brussels by Terveuren. The
drive is a very beautiful one, running along
the slope of the gentle, wooded hills, at the
foot of one of which Louvain is situated.
Terveuren is a pretty village built down
the glen between two hills, with a picturesque
old church on the summit of one
of them. It was formerly the seat of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
manufactures, and in 1759, Prince Charles
of Lorraine established in it works for
printing calico, and took the utmost pains
to bring artists from Switzerland and
Alsace, but it has long since been utterly
abandoned. The park, on the verge of
which the village is built, has been for
centuries the vice-regal residence for the
Austrian governors of the Netherlands. It
is beautifully wooded, and the irregularity of
the grounds afford some exquisite landscapes.
The present palace was erected
by the nation, and presented along with
that at Brussels to the Prince of Orange,
as a recognition of his services at Waterloo.
Like it, it has been waiting the fate of the
final treaty of partition, and its gorgeous
furniture, which has been undisturbed since
1830, is now in process of removal to the
Hague. The building has no external
beauty, a heavy solid edifice without decorations
of any kind, and its grand charms,
its paintings, and garniture, it derives from
the truly princely taste of its owner. We
drove home through the Forest of Soigné,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and through the village of Ixelles to Brussels.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We left Brussels this morning for Namur
through the forest of Soigné and across the
field of Waterloo. The forest is thick with
young straight trees; and any thing but picturesque.
The timber is chiefly beech with
oak and elm intermixed, and the trees are very
densely planted, with a view, we were told, to
render the wood loose and moist being withdrawn
from the hardy action of the air, in
order that when felled and cut into lengths
it may the more readily split, which the
beech does almost spontaneously. The
foresters live in huts dispersed throughout
the forest; and along the edge of the road
were long piles of cleft wood ready for
transport to Brussels. On the road we
passed several waggons laden with coals
from Charleroi, and after emerging from the
forest we reached the village of Waterloo,
which is situated almost upon its outskirts.
We visited the church with its numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
monuments to the “unreturning brave,”
and were solicited by some ecclesiastical
official for a contribution to the fund <i>for
keeping them in order</i>. At Mont St. Jean
we had a most comfortable breakfast at the
little inn, and being waited on by Sergeant
Cotton of the 7th Hussars, the guide who
seems to have most successfully taken the
place of Da Costa, we walked with him to
the various positions on the field. One has
really no patience with the great hulking
mountain of sand on which the Iron Lion is
raised as a trophy of the valour of the
“Braves Belges!” Some one has observed
that the pretension of the monuments at Waterloo
are precisely in the inverse ratio of
the importance of the services they commemorate;
the English have none, the Prussians
a modest record, and the Belgians a
pyramid! on which, as the Brussels guide
book magniloquently points out “the Lion
of Belgian proudly paws the bolt of war,
with his head turned towards vanquished
France, as if to menace her with vengeance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and teach her the homage which is due to
valour!” But it is not the gasconade of
this ambitious trophy that irritates one so
much as the fact, that in order to scrape
the earth together, out of which it is heaped
up, the whole surface of the field has been
disturbed and its identity destroyed; and
that, at the most interesting spot, where the
British guards made their immoveable and
immortal stand “from day-break till set
of sun” against all the chivalry of France.
The mischievous vanity, which has thus
destroyed what it pretends to commemorate,
has something very <i>Irish</i> in it, and is not
altogether without a parallel. Some years
since a remnant of a very ancient castle
of the chiefs of the clan O’Neil, which stood
upon the summit of the hill of Castlereagh
in the estate of the late Marquis of Downshire,
was fast crumbling away, owing to the
injury which it received from the cattle
who browsed about it, and his Lordship
directed that a wall should be built round
it to save it from utter destruction. The
labourers, however, who were sent for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
purpose, thinking it a pity to be at the trouble
of drawing stones up to the top of such
a mountain, where there were abundance
close at hand, very naïvely pulled down
what remained of the castle and built the
wall round its site with its own materials!</p>

<p>By the way, whilst all justice has been
done to the bravery of the English at Waterloo,
and all the credit to which they
were entitled, <i>at least</i>, claimed for the
Scotch regiments—it is a fact that speaks,
whole bulletins and gazettes for the gallantry
of the Irish, that the regiment which
had the greatest number <i>killed</i> of any on
the field was the 27th foot, the Enniskillens,
which lost one hundred and three men
besides three hundred and sixty wounded.</p>

<p>The Château of Hougemont is undergoing
a similar change, the wood which surrounded
it has been all cut down, new
buildings are erecting and the old ones fast
passing into dust—the gate, however, still
hangs upon its hinges with remnants of the
old leaves that witnessed the great day,
perforated by ten thousand bullets—the
little chapel stands almost roofless in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
ruinous court—and the guide points out
“with bated breath,” the walls of the barn
which was set on fire by the artillery and
consumed the wounded and the dying
who had been carried into it for shelter.

<p class="noin">The ruinous alcoves and grass grown walks
serve to show what it had once been—and
by its side is the orchard, the possession of
which on that memorable day was to decide
the freedom or the subjection of Europe.
It was then piled with carnage, and
strewn with “garments rolled in blood”—it
is now encumbered with a bending crop of
fruit, and one solitary grave over an English
officer, who was buried where he fell, is
the only memento of that fearful morning.
In the field around it, three thousand
French were slain by the well directed fire
from within; we walked over it as it had
been newly ploughed, and in the course of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
few minutes picked up a handful of bullets,
some fragments of shells and grape-shot,
and a musket flint still clasped in its
leaden envelope—what an iron shower
must have rained upon it, that after so
many years, the plough should still furrow
up its deposits!</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington has his estate
between Nivelles and Quatre Bras. Why
did not the King of Holland confer on him
the field itself? Above all, why are there
so many monuments to all the subalterns,
and none to the great Captain? It would
have been surely more just, as well as
wiser, to have reared that vast pyramid
to mark the spot where the conqueror stood,
than to provoke the remembrance that those
who intrude themselves upon our notice by
it, <i>four times turned to flight</i>. It is even said
that a party of the “braves Belges,” notwithstanding
all the terror in which they
were scampering back to Brussels, under
the panic that the day was lost, overtook
the Duke of Wellington’s baggage near the
forest of Soigné, and coolly took time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
plunder it—rather than let it fall into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Lord Byron mentions his impression that
Waterloo, as a plain, seems marked out for
the scene of some great action. This is, of
course, association in the imagination of the
poet; but it is a curious coincidence that, in
1707, the Duke of Marlborough selected it
as a desirable spot on which to encounter
the French, and actually encamped, for
many days, on the verge of the forest, in the
hope of seducing Vendome to give him
battle there.</p>

<p>At the little cabaret of La Belle Alliance,
to which we had sent our carriage on from
Mont St. Jean, to await our arrival from
Hougemont, we got some excellent light
wine: at Marengo, some years ago, I got
an equally refreshing draught, after a sultry
walk over the field of battle. Houses are
building at this little spot; and, in short, in
every direction trees are felled, ground levelled,
walls fallen, and cottages constructed;
so that in a few years the individual
features of the scene will be changed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
but that which even time cannot efface—its
deathless renown—will still, like Marathon,</p>

<blockquote><p>
Preserve alike its bounds and boundless fame. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>We took the usual route by Jemappe and
Quatre Bras, through the Waloon country.
The flax crop was abundantly spread over
the fields, undergoing the process of “dew
rating,” or dew riping, in which the operation
of detaching the cuticle from the wood
and pith, is performed by merely exposing
it on the grass without steeping. At Quatre
Bras the wood has been cut down from
which the British, under the Duke of Wellington,
repulsed Marshal Ney in the affair
of the 16th of June, in which the gallant
Duke of Brunswick fell. The hill is now a
naked height, which is seen on the right of
the road to Sombreffe.</p>

<p>The country, as we approach the banks
of the Meuse and the Sambre, becomes at
every step more and more picturesque, and
the dull monotonous plains of Brabant are
exchanged for the woody hills and precipitous
valleys of Namur. I never saw a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
charming prospect, nor one which is so truly
refreshing to an eye ennuied with the tiresome
monotony of Flemish scenery, than the
first view which is obtained of the old town
and fortress of Namur, from the heights
above the Sambre, in coming from Temploux—a
wide and winding valley, with the rapid
river toiling below between towering cliffs
of rugged rock upon the one hand, and steep
banks covered with foliage, and occasionally
crowned with old chateaux, upon the other;
and in the distance, the bridges, towers, and
steeples of the warlike old city, with its renowned,
and once thought impregnable fortress,
rising terrace upon terrace, and bristling
with artillery above it.</p>

<p>We drove down the steep hill to the river
under a glowing sunset, and having crossed
the hollow drawbridge and traversed the
tortuous passages that lead from the outward
fortifications to the heart of the city,
we took up our quarters for the night, at
the Hotel de Harscamp, in a starved little
square, that seemed to have been grudgingly
crimped off the already pinched and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
narrowed streets. It was still light enough
for a stroll round the fortifications, but we
soon discovered that it required the acumen
of some future Sir William Gell or Claudius
Rich, to determine the precise spot, which
we were in search of—namely, that at
which my Uncle Toby received his memorable
wound, in the attack made by the Dutch
and English, “upon the point of the advanced
counterscarp before the gate of
St. Nicholas, which enclosed the great
sluice or water-stop,” and which he himself
declares to have been, “in one of the
traverses about thirty toises from the
returning angle of the trench opposite to
the salient angle of the demi-bastion of
Saint Roche.”</p>

<p>The citadel which stands directly above the
town is constructed upon the shelves of a stupendous
rocky escarpment, that rises almost
perpendicularly from the banks of the river,
and looks like the Gibraltar of the Meuse.
It was accurately restored, and its works in
some places extended, by the King of
Holland, some few years before the revolution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
but when that event arrived, Namur
was amongst the first places that hoisted
the standard of revolt. There seems, in
fact, to have been something between
treason and cowardice in the conduct of the
garrisons, who occupied every fortress in
Belgium, and who, with the single exception,
I think, of Antwerp, surrendered them
to the “patrioterie” without lighting a
match.</p>

<p>In public buildings, Namur, has nothing
to exhibit, except two moderate churches:
one of them, the Cathedral, contains some
paintings, and the tomb of the gallant Don
John of Austria, the natural son of Charles V,
Barbara Blomberg of Ratisbon, who assumed
the credit of being his mother, in order, it is
said, to conceal a more illustrious parentage.
Don John, who, as the grand admiral at
Lepanto, combined, in his own person, the
functions of a naval as well as a military
commander, added to both the genius of a
diplomatist, and was invested with the
government of the Low Countries after the
pacification of Ghent. He, in person, obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
possession of the citadel of Namur,
by going thither under pretence of visiting
the Queen of Navarre, Margaret of Valois,
who was enjoying the gaiety of Spa, and
being permitted to walk on the glacis, and
finally to view the interior, by the young
son of the governor, in the absence of his
father, he took the opportunity to entrench
his immediate guard as a garrison in the
name of his brother of Spain, who the next
year rewarded his bravery, by causing him
to be poisoned, to avoid a marriage, which
he apprehended between the hero of Lepanto
and Queen Elizabeth of England. He
died at the camp of Bongy, a short distance
from Namur, in 1578, when only thirty-three
years of age.</p>

<p>The other church, that of St. Loup, is
overlaid with a profusion of decorations of
all descriptions, paintings, carved confessionals
and gilded altars, its floor is of
variegated marble, the columns which sustain
the vaults of the roof are polished porphyry
or red granite, with square plinths,
interposed between each tambour in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
shaft, and the ceiling which is of solid white
stone, is laboriously chased from end to end
in a multitude of florid devices, so accurately
raised out and under cut, that the
whole looks like a Chinese sculpture in ivory.
Tradition says, the carving of the entire
roof, was the work of one individual monk
of the Jesuits, by whom the church was
erected.</p>

<p>The town itself has nothing else to shew,
except its tall gaunt-looking old houses,
crowded into narrow lanes and passages,
the dullness of which is only relieved
by the showy windows of its shops,
shining with cutlery and polished brass
work, the staple trade of Namur. It divides
this manufacture with Gembloux, a little
town, a few miles to the north, which is as
famous for the coarser articles of “Sheffield
ware,” as Namur is for the finer. The
prosperity of the trade, however, has been
declining ever since 1814, when Belgium
not only lost the French market, but the
protection of the French douaniers to protect
her own from being invaded by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
English; her decline was consummated by
losing, in addition, the supply of the Dutch
colonies, by the events of “the glorious
days” of September 1830, and the entire
of the workmen now engaged at Namur,
do not exceed one thousand. Cheapness
is of course their grand aim, and some penknives
which we bought surprisingly low,
we speedily discovered, like Peter Pindar’s
cutlery to be “made <i>for sale</i>.”</p>

<p>The Athenæum of Namur has attained
some celebrity by the chair of geology,
which was established by the King of Holland,
and for the study of which, the rocky
ravines and valleys of the environs present
abundant opportunities.</p>

<p>The Hotel de Harscamp is excellent, and
after a most comfortable night, disturbed
only by the thundering moans of a most
inopportune réveille, rung, from the
bells of the church hard by, every
night at <i>eleven</i>, and every morning at <i>four</i>
o’clock; we started, before breakfast the
following morning for Huy and Liege,
along the descent of the Meuse. The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
delightful scenery accompanied us, which
we had overtaken the evening before on
descending to Namur. On either side,
high, beetling cliffs of limestone and basalt,
in every crevice of which, spring the hardy
roots of the little mountain ash, now covered
with its ruby berries, and from every
crag, luxuriant creepers hung down their
“lush of leaves,” which the early frost was
already beginning to tinge with crimson.
Every spot that could afford soil for the
roots of a tree, was covered with waving
foliage, and into the rich recesses of the
cliffs ran up little velvety meadows from
the verge of the river, in which were
nestled some of the most beautiful and romantic
villas and chateaux. Occasionally,
on the summit of the steep ravine, in the
distance, were perched the buildings of a
suppressed convent, or the ruins of some
feudal castle; and the very limestone rock
itself, worn into fantastic shapes by the
weather, not unfrequently presented all the
features of a fortress, jutting out over the
river below it. The road ran along a broad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
rich plain, intersected by the river, with
fruit-trees planted along the hedge-rows,
and yellow crops of corn which had not yet
been severed. The boats were already on
the river, and innumerable cars and waggons
were toiling along the road, laden with
produce for Namur—it was precisely the
scene and the season described in Wordsworth’s
sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The morn that now along the silver Meuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spreading her peaceful ensigns, calls the swains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tend their silent boats and ringing wains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or strip the bough, whose mellow fruit bestrews</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ripening corn beneath.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the beauty of the Meuse is its least
recommendation to the affection of the Belgians;
and, like the vale of Avoca, and
the banks of some other equally exquisite
streams, which are “<i>sacred</i> only in song,”
its picturesque attractions, are, at every
spot, most rudely torn away by the very
matter-of-fact speculators of the neighbourhood,
in the search of the mineral treasures
which they conceal. Rocks of black
marble are rolled down to the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
road, and left ready for transport to
the river; limestone is tumbled from
the cliffs, and numerous manufactories of
alum are constructed between Namur <span class="err" title="original: and and">and</span>
Schlayen. These and the other riches
of the Meuse, its floors of coal and beds of
iron render this rugged defile the most
important and valuable possession of the
crown.</p>

<p>At Andennes we passed the first of those
vast manufactories, the establishment of
which has made the name of one Englishman
more renowned in Belgium than those
of all its native speculators combined—Mr.
William Cockerill. Every district of
the kingdom exhibits some memorial of his
enterprise, and there is scarcely a branch
of the national industry which, if it does
not owe its introduction to his suggestion,
is not indebted to his genius for its improvement.
He came to Verviers in 1798,
an humble mechanic, in search of employment,
returning with a numerous family
from Stockholm, where he had been to
erect some apparatus for spinning wool.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
He obtained an engagement with a house
there to construct for them machinery for
the same purpose, similar to that in use in
England, and by dint of singular talents,
unwearied industry, and energies almost unparalleled,
he speedily elevated himself to
wealth and importance; mines were sounded
at his suggestion, iron-works constructed,
cotton-mills built, woollen-machinery erected,
in short, every department of Belgian
art received a new impulse under his all-grasping
and comprehensive superintendence,
aided by the munificence of Napoleon,
and, subsequently, by the equally ardent
co-operation of King William of Holland,
who seemed to place the national
funds for the promotion of industry, almost
at his disposal. Under the powerful
influence of France, and even afterwards with
access to the extensive markets and colonies
of Holland, the vastness of his speculations
were not disproportionate to the wants and
commercial connexions of the kingdom.
But the simile of a tub for a whale is no
actual exaggeration to represent the incompatibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
of his Leviathan establishments,
to the puny resources of the new and independent
kingdom, within which they were
suddenly walled up by the revolution of
1830. The gross of green spectacles which
Moses brought home from the fair, were
not more utterly disproportionate to the
wants of the family of the Vicar of Wakefield.</p>

<p>The establishment of Andennes had been
originally constructed by the act of the
government and the King of Holland, for
the printing of calicoes in the style, and
with a view to out-rival the English—every
process was borrowed from them, the machinery,
the workmen, the designs, were
all brought from England, and, for a time,
the concern seemed to be prosperous. But
the events of 1830 soon put a stop to that;
it was useless to print calicoes while there
was no stranger to buy, and no one at home
to wear them, and in the course of a few
years, the works were sold by order of the
government to pay off their advances, and
bought by their original promoter, who
converted them into a paper-mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span></p>

<p>This trade is now one of the most prosperous
in Belgium. She formerly imported
her paper from France at from
twenty to five-and-twenty per cent. dearer
than she can now produce it for herself,
thanks to the ingenuity and enterprise of
Mr. Cockerill, which gave the manufacture
a new character by the introduction of the
machines for producing the entire contents
of the vat in one continuous sheet.
Since that period, the manufacture has advanced
with a rapidity that is quite surprising.
In 1836 there were <i>seven</i> machines
on the same construction in use in
Belgium; in 1839 <i>nineteen</i>, but of these
<i>six</i> have now been attached to Holland by
her acquisitions in Luxembourg and Limbourg.
The value of their produce is upwards
of nine millions of francs per annum,
and their success has communicated an
impulse to the production of books at
Brussels, that has rendered it likewise one
of the most important and promising
branches of the national industry.</p>

<p>A few miles from Andennes, after passing
a romantic old ruin of the castle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Dukes of Beaufort near Bien, we stopped
to breakfast at the foot of the romantic
fortress of Huy, which was long considered
as the portal of the Meuse, till its inefficiency
was demonstrated by Marlborough
and Marshal Villeroy in “King William’s
wars,” who took and retook it four times
within as many years, almost without a
struggle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huy</span> is beautifully situated at the angle,
where a mountain torrent pours past it to the
Meuse. Its fortress stands on a bold detached
rock, of great height and breadth, around
the base of which the town is built almost upon
the sands of the river; and beneath its shelter
are collected the churches, monasteries,
and houses of the ancient city. The fortifications
are now in excellent repair, having been
restored after the war by English engineers
under the direction of Colonel Blanshard,
at the expense of the King of Holland;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
but the town itself is fast hurrying to decay.
Its vicinity to Seraing, the seat of the once
powerful Prince Bishops of Liege, rendered
Huy a place of evident interest as an ecclesiastical
frontier as well as a military one;
and the church militant below, emulous of
the strongholds of earthly power above, had
within the small circuit of its wall no less
than a cathedral, fourteen churches, and a
still greater number of monasteries, abbeys,
and convents, all of which, with the exception
of the cathedral and a richly carved
gateway that conducts to it, are now in ruins.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time in Belgium, we
saw vineyards and their “purple store;” but
the wine is execrable, and used only for the
most inferior purposes. The position of
Huy on the river, and its admirable facilities
for traffic, made it a flourishing entrepôt for
grain and agricultural produce, in which it
carries on a bustling traffic on the river; as
well as in the produce of its numerous
quarries. A short distance from Huy commence
the coal fields, which extend to the
district surrounding Liege, the working of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
which was attempted so far back as the 12th
century. In coals, Belgium is, perhaps, the
richest country of the west of Europe, with
the single exception of Great Britain; the
districts in which it abounds being, in England,
in the proportion of one-twentieth of
her entire surface; in Belgium, a thirtieth;
and in France only a two hundredth part.
But her success in raising them is not in
the same proportion, England having produced,
in 1838, <i>twenty-three millions</i> of tons;
France, <i>two millions and a half</i>; and Belgium
only <i>four</i>.</p>

<p>The principal mining districts are in Hainault,
where those of Charleroi and Mons
are not only the most productive, but exhibit
the best specimens as to quality; those of
Liege, which are next; and those of Huy
and Namur. Some valuable coal mines at
Limbourg have been ceded to Holland by
the treaty of 1839, another cause of dissatisfaction
to the Belgians. The prosperity
of the mining trade has been affected by all
the changing fortunes of the country; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
its general march, though liable to great
vicissitudes, has been in the ultimate result
successful and improving. A few years
since such was the rage for joint stock
speculations, and the mania for erecting
machinery in Belgium, that a panic
was excited lest the veins of coal and iron
should be exhausted prematurely, so rapid
was the consumption of both which the
force of speculation had produced. The
price, in consequence, rose from 50 to 100
per cent, and an application was made and
acceded to by the British Government, to
permit the free exportation of coal from
Newcastle to Flanders; but in the year following
the alarm subsided, from very natural
causes, and the price returned to its
former level.</p>

<p>The quantity produced in Belgium for
some years past has not exceeded, on an
average, three millions of tons; and the
ordinary price has been about 10 francs at
the pit’s mouth. The cost of carriage, however,
and the variety of modes and distances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of conveyance, render its prices at the
various places of consumption extremely
unequal. According to M. Briavionne,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the
following was the scale in 1837:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">AT BRUSSELS:</p>

<p>The price of coals in England, at the same
period, was <i>twenty-two</i> to <i>twenty-three</i> shillings
for what cost <i>thirty-five</i> at Brussels; and
from sixteen to twenty for the others, for
which the Belgians paid from <i>twenty-five</i> to
<i>twenty-seven</i>. The cost at the pit’s mouth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>at the same time, was but a shade higher at
Newcastle than at Hainault or Liege,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> so
relatively imperfect are the means of communication
in Belgium as contrasted with
those of Great Britain; and, besides, the coal
floors are much more accessible and thicker
in the latter country than in the other, where
the upper strata has been already pretty well
exhausted by upwards of six hundred years
of continued workings.</p>

<p>The view, on looking back at this hardy
old town, is remarkably striking—its citadel
almost by nature a fortress, independently
of engineering; and, at its foot, the antique
cathedral, founded by Peter the Hermit.
The banks of the Meuse, and the Vesdre,
have been prolific in great names; Godfrey
of Bouillon, the leader of the first crusade,
was born at Poisy, on the borders of Namur;
Tilly, one of the great military adventurers
of the Thirty Years, came from a
village still nearer the Meuse; Hersthal,
the birth-place of Pepin, “the Mayor of the
Palace,” and the founder of the kings of the
second race in France, lies a mile below
Liege; and at Herve, between it and Verviers,
Lebrun, the minister of France, who
died on the scaffold, in 1794, was employed
as the editor of a provincial newspaper.</p>

<p>The scenery, on either side of the river,
improves in richness, but loses in grandeur,
as we approach Liege. The ravine through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
which it rolls, between Huy and Namur,
widens out into a fertile valley towards
Seraing, still enclosed, however, by precipitous
cliffs, on which castles, châteaux,
and monasteries are perched, in positions
that seem, from below, at least, to
be all but inaccessible. Two, in particular,
are most strikingly picturesque—the châteaux
of Aigremont, between Flaune and
Engis, and another above the village of
Chokier, at present occupied by a Russian
nobleman, whose visitors would certainly
require a balloon and a parachute “to drop
in upon him.”</p>

<p>On driving round a projecting angle of
the cliff, at a turn in the course of the river,
we came in view of the vast buildings and
innumerable chimneys of the great iron
works at Seraing. These enormous works
are certainly one of the wonders of Belgium;
and Europe, in point of extent, possesses
nothing to compare with them. Nor can
one regard this vast temple to the genius of
Fulton and Watt, without emotions of
amazement, at the lightning speed with
which their discoveries have revolutionized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the whole aspect of European industry, and
created wants and expedients which, half a
century ago, were unfelt and unknown; but
the pressure of which, at the present day,
has forced into existence such a gigantic
establishment as Seraing. Compared with
the largest manufactories in England, Seraing
is as a mammoth to an ant-hill. The
quantity of actual creative power which it
engenders and pours forth, year by year, is,
perhaps, equal to that of a whole generation
of artizans, in the best days of Flemish
prosperity; and a river, of ordinary current,
flowing through a country of manufactures
scarcely communicates a greater impetus to
the production of the necessaries, or the
comforts of life, than the steam engines
which Seraing is capable of sending forth in
the compass of a single year.</p>

<p>The circuit of its own walls encompasses
everything essential to the completion of
the most ponderous engine;—two coal
mines are worked within them—the iron ore
is raised, washed, and smelted on the spot;
canals and railroads, all within its gase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
convey those cumbrous materials from process
to process, from furnace to forge,
till the crude mineral which, issued from
the earth in its ore, is carried from the
ware-room in the form of all but intelligent
machines.</p>

<p>Seraing was many years in attaining its
present singular development. It was commenced
in 1817, by the sons of the ingenious
individual, whom I have already
mentioned as entering Verviers an impoverished
mechanic, and finally contributing,
by the impulse of his single mind, to
advance the march of manufacturing improvement
in Belgium by, at least, half a
century. The buildings in which, or rather,
around which its multifarious works are
now congregated, was formerly the magnificent
palace of the Prince Bishops of Liege,
on whose abolition it became the property
the crown. The brothers, Charles James,
and John Cockerill, whose father had already
established extensive manufactories of machinery
at Liege and transmitted them to
his children, conceived the idea of transfering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
their industry to Seraing, struck with
its commanding advantages, the presence
of coal and iron, and its facilities of water
communication in every direction, by means
of the river which flowed below its walls.
To occupy all its space, one wing was fitted
up for the spinning of linen yarn, and was
so employed till 1822, when the extension
of their business in the other branches, required
the rooms which it engrossed. In
1819, they commenced raising their own
coal; and in 1824, they were enabled to
work iron, the produce of their own mines
and furnaces. The extraordinary encouragement
given to every species of manufacture
requiring machinery, under the
régime of Holland, was a source of continued
prosperity; and even the unhealthy
plethora of speculation, which has existed
in Belgium since the revolution, however
disastrous to others, afforded constant employment
to the workmen of Seraing, and
contributed to expand it to its present unexampled
extent.</p>

<p>At the little village of Jemeppe, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
on the same side of the river with the high
road, we left the carriage, and crossed over
in a ferry boat to the works, over which we
were obligingly conducted by one of the
superintendants. The outward edifices are
all in the same condition as when occupied
by the Prince Bishop, and one wing is still
the residence of Mr. Cockerill’s family. It
consists of three squares, or courtyards,
opening one into the other by noble archways,
the first of which is still surmounted
by the arms of the prelate, with his motto—“<i>je
maintiendrai</i>.” The grand front contained
the apartments of the Prince himself,
the second court that of his officers and
suite, and the third was appropriated for the
household and stables, and now forms, with
the floors on the second story, four apartments,
each two hundred feet in length!
The whole building, with its noble façade,
and the remains of fine timber which surround
it, still retains an air of magnificence
suitable to its former fortune. The gardens
in the rear are now all covered over with
workshops, forges, furnaces, and store-houses;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and behind these, still further retiring
to the river, are the coal fields and
iron mines; the whole forming literally a
<i>town</i> within itself, daily animated by upwards
of 2,000 workmen, in all the various
branches of its comprehensive system.</p>

<p>Externally, except from the smoke of its
chimneys at a distance, one would scarcely
discern the nature of the vast operations
going on within; but before the grand
entrance on the bank of the river there lay
a <span class="err" title="original: hugh">huge</span> specimen of its productions,—a gigantic
cylinder, for a steam-engine to be
sent to Prussia, of two hundred and fifty
horse power, and of such dimensions, that
this one limb of it alone was seven feet in
diameter, and weighed upwards of twelve
tons. Besides two huge furnaces for smelting
the raw ore, there are upwards of thirty others
for the washing, puddling, and treatment of
the iron in its various stages; eighty forges,
two iron founderies, and one of copper; one
vast hall for the construction of boilers,
another for fly-wheels, and all the portions
of steam-engines, and a third for locomotives;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
besides innumerable apartments for
every other species of heavy machinery,
rooms for designers and magazines of
models. (The spinning, and other light
machinery, is manufactured at another
establishment at Liege.) The whole is set
in motion by seventeen steam-engines,
whose united power exceeds nine hundred
horses, and the consumption of coals for
these and the furnaces is four hundred
tons a day, the cost of raising which,
we were told, was fifteen francs a ton. Its
productions comprehend the whole range of
English machinery for every department of
industry, and its produce is exported to
every manufacturing country to which it
has a commodious communication—to
Russia, to Prussia, to Germany, Spain, Italy
and France and even to South America. Every
new invention which succeeds in Great
Britain has been re-produced at Seraing,
within a short time of its appearance with us.</p>

<p>The rooms and vast halls, from the ample
construction of the building, present an appearance
quite startling to a stranger, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
may not be prepared for the unusual spectacle
of a single chamber fitted up with five
hundred vices along the sides, and all alive
with the rush of wheels and the din of
machines of every description, in action in
the centre. The workmen are all Belgians,
not a single English mechanic being now
employed. Their tools, however, were
chiefly from Manchester, and in reply to a
remark, that at Ghent the Phœnix made its
own; the superintendant observed, that
they had tried the experiment and found
that they could be had both cheaper and
better from England. So many as 2,800
workmen have been at one time employed
at Seraing, at wages varying from three
francs a day to five or six, but would average
about four francs round, exclusive of
designers, whose gains are more considerable.
The establishment has been latterly
less regularly employed, owing to a damp
upon speculation in general, and the completion
of the contracts for the various railroads,
and not above 2000 hands are now engaged.
The whole concern is, likewise, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
present in confusion, owing to the recent
death of the proprietor, which will occasion
the entire to be disposed of for the settlement
of his affairs. The extent of his speculations
in every branch of industry, and
almost in every country of Europe, is almost
incredible. He was concerned in no less
than fifty different mines, and factories for
spinning and weaving cotton, woollens, and
linen, for the manufacture of paper and
printed calicoes, for grinding flour, making
carding machines, and in short, every promising
branch of industry in Belgium,
France, and Germany. His property at
Seraing has been estimated (I cannot answer
for how correctly) at 10,000,000<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of
francs, and his factory for spinning machinery
at Liege 3,000,000, his paper mills
and buildings at Andennes 2,900,000, his
flour mills at Cottbus, in Silesia, 500,000,
his woollen factory at St. Denis 500,000,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>his card machinery at Spa 400,000, and his
shares in various other manufactories in
Belgium and elsewhere 25,000,000. In
Belgium, in fact, there has been a mania
for joint-stock speculation, scarcely equalled
by the bubbles of 1825 in Great Britain,
and attended with equally ruinous results.
Mr. Cockerill’s encouragement and participation
in these adventures to such an extent,
is one source of the activity and astonishing
development of Seraing; the funds of these
adventurers and his own, along with the
rest, being vested in the purchase of machinery
manufactured by himself. In the
event of their success, the speculation might
have been a wise one, but followed as they
have been in most instances by disappointment,
the result to the proprietor of Seraing,
at least, can have been little more
than keeping his forges employed out of his
own capital.</p>

<p>Still whoever may have been the individual
sufferer, Seraing is a stupendous example
of enterprize and skill, and if placed
upon a suitable financial basis, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
singular facilities of fuel and iron, cannot
fail, under almost any circumstances, to be
a vigorous concern. The quality of its iron
is excellent: this ore yields from twenty-five
to seventy-five, and some veins so
much as eighty-five per cent.; though that
of Belgium in general does not exceed thirty
per cent.; and except for some very fine purposes.
Seraing is perfectly independent of
any importation beyond its own walls. For
copper and brass it is, however, dependent
upon England and Sweden, none whatever
being produced in Belgium, so far as I
could learn. One invaluable benefit it has
already rendered to Belgium, it has served
as a vast college for the education of mechanics;
and in the course of twenty years,
it has produced thousands of artizans who
have branched off into the other provinces,
and formed the rival establishments of
Ghent, Brussels, Charleroi, Mons, Namur
and Tournai. “The Belgians,” says
M. Briavionne, “have a natural taste
for mechanics, and combine the two essentials
to success—perseverance and enterprize.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
But these qualities would never
have been called into action, nor their own
resources developed had England, from the
first, permitted the free export of her machinery,
or Belgium imposed any restrictions
upon its import.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The importations
of machinery from England, notwithstanding
native enterprize have been very considerable
more especially of those half-animated
engines know by the inappropriate,
and ill-understood term of “tools,” which
seem to be the very life and sustenance
of the rival manufacture of Belgium. In
1830, the Belgian official returns exhibit
an import to the value of only 46,372fr., in
1835 it had risen to 464,377fr., in 1836 to
3,291,275fr., in 1837 it was 2,851,451fr.,
and in 1838, 4,708,237fr.</p>

<p>From Seraing to Liege, a distance of
three or four miles, the drive is exceedingly
beautiful, the valley of the Meuse
here expands into broad and luxuriant meadows,
and the steep cliffs which accompanied
us from Namur, lean back into rich
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>and verdant hills whose summits are covered
with timber, and their base studded
with white and cheerful villas. In the midst
of this picturesque scenery, the old town of
Liege bursts upon us at a sudden turn of
the road, built at the foot of the steep hill
of St. Walberg which is covered with its
churches and palaces, and spreading down
to the Meuse which sweeps round its base
to meet the waters of the Ourthe and the
Vesdre which unite within it.</p>

<p>Liege is certainly the least interesting of
all the great towns of the Netherlands, not
that the events of its ancient times are less
stirring, but the character of their prominent
actions is less engaging and their quarrels
less chivalrous; in its modern state, it
possesses scarcely a single attractive remnant
of antiquity—no paintings, no statues,
no architectural beauties or remains. Its
streets are narrow, irregular and dirty, and
the houses devoid of any thing venerable
or characteristic. Still the old chronicles of
Monstrelet and Philip de Comines, and the
quaint tradition of the “wild boar of Ardennes”
and the feuds of the Dukes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Brabant and Burgundy, with the insolent
burghers, and the alternate ascendancies
and indignities of the Prince Bishops, and
the rude and savage deeds of the inhuman
Louis XI, are all full of historic interest,
though of a repulsive and painful kind.</p>

<p>Liege had been the See of a Bishop for
fourteen hundred years, when the annexation
of Belgium to France put a close to
the dynasty of its sovereign prelates. Its
rank was such amongst ecclesiastical cities,
that it was visited by the Popes and the
Emperors; and its citizens intoxicated, at
once, with affluence and arrogance became
the most turbulent and insubordinate faction
that ever “strangled the prosperity” of
a community. M. Ferrier in an historical
résumé, prefixed to his “Description de
Liège,” thus sums up the condition of the
burghers in the 12th century. “The morals
and manners of the citizens became corrupted,
at once, by the acquisition of extraordinary
wealth, and the extortion of inordinate
privileges from the Prince Bishops
who were their ecclesiastical sovereigns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
The artisans accustomed to extravagant
gains, gave but a portion of their time to
industry, and devoted the rest to the discussion
of affairs of state, in the places of
public resort. The Prelate Albert de Cuyck,
unable to subdue their murmuring and disquieted
spirit, retreated behind concession
after concession, till in 1198, he confirmed
to them a Charter, which invested the men
of Liege with privileges such as were unheard
of in the age in which they lived.
But these concessions so far from tranquillizing,
seemed but to excite them to fresh
demands—the more ample the favours
yielded, the more exorbitant became their
further requirements—till in the end, their
restless ambition embroiled the city in contests
of blood such as have tinged the page
of their history from century to century.
The clergy, at first, made common cause
with the people against the power of the
<i>haute noblesse</i>, who enjoyed at once all military
and magisterial authority in the state;
till the multitude disturbed from the pursuits
of peaceful industry, became, at length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the sport of ungovernable impulses, sometimes
generous in their origin, but which
were too often degraded into brutalized ferocity
for the mere gratification of revenge.
The nobles were the first sacrifice to the
popular demands, and the clergy who succeeded
to their power, became in turn their
fellow victims.” The whole story of their
contests is, in fact, one succession of revolts,
not for the redress of wrongs or the assertion
of liberty, but for the lust of licentious
and uncontrolled democracy. Occasionally,
too, in the long succession of its Prince Bishops,
there occurred some whose authority,
instead of being exerted to control, was
but employed to exasperate the fury of
the populace, and to such an air of arrogance
did some of these kingly prelates assume,
that one of them, John Louis d’Elderen,
presumed, single-handed, to declare war
against Louis XIV in 1686! who rewarded
his temerity by directing Marshal Boufflers
to beat down the fortification of Liege
about his ears, an instruction which he duly
attended to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>In later times, Liege was a fief of the
empire, and the Prince Bishop, the elector,
had a vote as representing a portion of the
circle of Westphalia. In 1830, its inhabitants,
with a true hereditary taste for turmoil, were
the first to take up arms on the intelligence
of the revolution, and a band of patriots,
mustered and marshalled by M. Rogier,
marched from Liege to Brussels to aid in
expelling the house of Nassau, but with the
intention of merely transfering the kingdom
from that dynasty to France, a project
which was overruled by the clergy and
the northern insurgents. With that frightful
impulse which in popular, not less than
individual frenzy, drives its victims into
the violence of hatred of all that they
ought to cherish, and has sometimes forced
maniacs to eat their own flesh;—the first
fury of the patriots was directed against the
manufacturing establishments, whence they
drew their bread; and nothing but the firm
affection of the workmen at Seraing to
their master, and the resolution to protect
his property, saved that magnificent temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
of industry from being itself committed to
the flames, by the worshippers of the rival
goddess of liberty.</p>

<p>With less of elegance and attraction,
there is an equal air of business-like energy
and bustling activity in the streets of Liege,
as at Ghent. The Meuse is navigable
from the city to the sea, and its quays are
frequented by the craft, which convey its
produce to the various cities along its
course, Ruremonde and Venloo to Gorcum,
Dordrecht and the Rhine. Its streets are
crowded with an incessant stream of waggons,
carriages and carts, and in the better
streets and squares, the shops are as gay
and attractive as those of the Rue Montagne
de la Cour at Brussels.</p>

<p>Coupled with its ancient fiery and quarrelsome
disposition, its chief manufacture
is a characteristic one, being that of cannon
and fire-arms, which it at one time, exported
to Spain, Portugal, Holland and America.
Under France, the imperial factory of
arms furnished annually, twenty-seven
thousand muskets for the imperial army.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
A story is told that the rest of the trade,
anxious to share in the profits of the
monopoly, besought Napoleon to admit
them to a share of the supply, and presented
him with a finely-finished piece as
a specimen of their talents. But as, either
by accident or malice, the bore of the
barrell was too narrow to admit the ramrod,
the Emperor gave no other answer than a
frown to their ill-supported petition. Under
Holland in 1829, the production of
Liege amounted to no less than 190,660
stand of arms; in 1836, it rose to
nearly double that quantity, but it is at
present, fallen much <i>below one half</i>, and the
trade is still in a state of decline. The
manufacture is carried on at the homes of
the workmen, who, nevertheless, established
a perfect division of labour in producing
the various parts, and can furnish
the entire at a lower rate than either Birmingham
or France, a double-barrelled gun
can be had for thirty or even twenty
francs. The percussion lock has not yet
been substituted in the Belgian army for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the flint. The cannon foundery is calculated
to produce 300 pieces a year; and in
1837, the most flourishing period of the
trade, it even exceeded that number.</p>

<p>There is a flax-spinning mill at Liege with
10,000 spindles, the property of a joint-stock
company, of whom Mr. Cockerill was the
chief proprietor. Its works are now languid,
owing to a want of consumption, and
a gentleman acquainted with its affairs,
spoke very despondingly of its prospects.
Coals, though found in the immediate
neighbourhood, are dear, as they lie deep,
and we saw them generally mixed into balls
with clay for the use of the stoves in the
hotels and private houses, an indication
that their price is a stimulant to economy.</p>

<p>As might be anticipated from its having so
long been the residence of the most eminent
prelate in the Low Countries, Liege abounds
in churches, there being some eighteen or
twenty for a population of 50,000 inhabitants.
They are, however, destitute of
all attractions, except that of St. Jacques,
which is a very excellent example of florid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
got his architecture. The others are common-place
structures, devoid of all valuable
decorations of any kind, except a few indifferent
statues by Delcour the sculptor,
who was himself a native of the city. The
Palais de Justice was formerly the residence
of the Prince Bishops, and in its ample
arcades, supported by truncated columns,
exhibits traces of its former magnificence.
The University, which has some eminent
professors, especially of natural philosophy,
was another foundation of the King of
Holland, and besides a library of some
seventy or eighty thousand volumes, contains
Museums of Natural History, and
Minerals of unusual value. But every
thing connected with modern Liege is common-place
and uninteresting; its only
charm is its exquisite situation at the juncture
of the three beautiful valleys of the
Meuse, the Ourthe and the Vesdre, and a
very brief sojourn is sufficient to satisfy the
stranger in pursuit of “fresh fields and
pastures new.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We left Liege before breakfast for Verviers
through the exquisite valley of the
Vesdre, which, as it is narrower and more
tortuous than the descent of the Meuse, excels
it in picturesque beauty, though inferior
in the grandeur of its general effect.
The entire line of the road was through
richly wooded glens and ravines, where the
river had forced a passage between the fantastic
cliffs which time had wrought into
shapes like fortresses or the battlements of
ruined strongholds. Below, the Vesdre itself,
too shallow to be navigated, twists round
each sweep of the winding cliffs, now shining
in the sunlight, and again scarcely
visible under the dark shadows of the trees
and rocks. The lover of the picturesque
will shudder to be told, that it is through
this charming valley that the railroad is to
be carried to connect Liege with Verviers
on its way to Cologne, and even now the
engineers are at work levelling, blasting,
and uprooting to make way for it, cutting
off a projecting cliff here, and filling up a
useless ravine there, and flinging lofty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
embankments across the entrance of the
sweetest recesses of the valley, into which
you are only admitted to have a peep through
the archway on which the train is to traverse
the highway.</p>

<p>About four miles from Liege, in one of
the glens of this beautiful river, is Chaudefontaine,
a spring which has long been the
holiday resort of the Liegois, and has now
grown into a miniature watering place,
with its hotels and other agrémens. And
half way to Verviers, a road striking in
between the hills on the right leads to Spa,
one of the superannuated favourites of
fashion, which has long since yielded the
throne to younger and gayer rivals. The
crowd now rolls past the turn in the road
which leads to it, eager to reach Carlsbad
or Wisbaden, and no longer contented, as
in the Sir Charles Grandison age, to pace
the “<i>Promenades de quatre heures</i>,” walk minuets
in the “<i>Vauxhall</i>,” or make stately
excursions to the cottages of Marmontel’s
Annette and Lubin. Still the country and
scenery around it, and the magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
mountains and woods of the Ardennes
yield, in nothing, to the attractions of the
later protegées of <i>ton</i>, but along with the
rest of the ungrateful crowd, we too declined
the open door of the antiquated and
neglected beauty, and kept on the road to
Verviers.</p>

<p>Verviers is a long straggling, but by no
means ordinary town, stretching along the
banks of the Vesdre, whenever the command
of the stream presented a desirable
site for a factory. In this, nearly 20,000
inhabitants and their machinery are located
along the stream, and the uplands forming,
certainly, one of the most cheerful and
healthy manufacturing communities in Europe.
The grand staples, are wool in all its
varieties of worsted and cloth, in the production
of which the valley has long enjoyed
a high reputation in Holland and
France, and its goods are still exported to
Italy and the Levant. Like the people of
Liege, the workmen of Verviers caught the
infection of the revolutionary mania in
1830, but their madness exhibited itself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
a still more savage form. On the first
intelligence of the revolt, they sprung, eager
for the fray, and at once manifested their
wishes, by hoisting the tri-colour of France,
with whom they demanded an instant incorporation.
The town has neither fortress
nor garrison, and for two days it was the
scene of the most disgusting and uncontrolled
excesses. The people assembled
in tumultuous masses, and with shouts of
“liberty,” tore down the royal insignia of
the Netherlands, and razed to the ground
the houses of the government officers; factories
were destroyed, machinery demolished,
and the whole property of the flourishing
valley seemed destined to destruction
from the freaks of this drunken revolution.
At length the soberer citizens, forming
an urban guard and a council of safety,
succeeded in restoring order, and securing
their property from the fingers of the
children of “Freedom.”</p>

<p>The woollen trade of the Andennes, is one
of the oldest national occupations of the
Netherlands, and for the share of it which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
we enjoy in England, we are indebted to
the fanatical fury of Philip II., whose persecutions
drove the weavers of Brabant and
Flanders to seek an asylum with Elizabeth
in England. Unlike its other great
staple of linen, however, Belgium, in
her woollen manufacture, is dependant
upon others for the raw material which
she employs; the entire of her possessions
do not feed beyond a single million of
sheep, and her annual imports of wool from
Germany, Holland, England and Spain, exceed
15,000,000 francs. The two grand
seats of the trade, though distributed over
a considerable district of the south, are at
Verviers and Dison, which each produce
annually from 30 to 35,000 pieces of thirty
ells of Brabant in length. The manufacture
is chiefly carried on in the houses of the
workmen, and in some places, especially
at Dison, the employers are so deficient in
capital, that the truck system is universal,
and the weaver paid by a portion of his own
produce, which he must afterwards sell under
the pressure for bread, at such a price as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
he can get for it; an act of injustice to the
operative, which must always tend to the
manifest injury of prices, and undermining
of the trade.</p>

<p>Down to 1814, the trade was in every
way prosperous, but the successive curtailments
of consumption, first by the exclusion
from France, and, finally, by separation
from Holland, have shaken its stability, and
brought it into a state of considerable peril
at the present moment. Still the number
of factories have not diminished, although
the rate of profits has been cut down to the
lowest possible figure, especially at Verviers.
It gives employment, at present, to between
15,000 and 20,000 individuals of all ages,
whose wages vary from half a franc per day
for children, to two francs, and two francs
and a half for their fathers. The countries
to which Belgium still exports are Switzerland,
Germany, Italy, the Levant, and Holland;
but a commercial treaty between
the latter country and France, is said to
have been framed with a view to transfer to
French cloth, the preference now given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
that of Verviers in the Dutch market. Her
exportations, however, exhibit an incredible
decline since the revolution. In 1831, its
value amounted to <i>twenty-seven</i> millions of
francs; in 1832 to <i>twenty-three</i>; in 1833,
it fell to one half, and in 1836, declined to
<i>six millions and a half</i>, a diminution which
is ascribable to numerous causes, but chiefly
to its exclusion from Germany, by the
operation of the Prussian commercial league;
the states of which were once, previously,
its most valuable consumers. Germany, in
1831 and 1832, took no less than 1,000,000
kilogrammes of Belgian cloth, which fell,
in 1833, to 344,000, and on an average of
the four succeeding years, has scarcely
exceeded 250,000.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the vicissitudes
of the woollen trade of Belgium, thus
driven, within five-and-twenty years, from
the markets of France and her colonies, Holland,
Java, and Germany, and, shut up
within the narrow circle of her new independence,
to maintain a competition with
her two powerful rivals—the English and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the French. Its present condition and
prospects are thus noticed in the intelligent
volume of M. Briavionne. “After
having participated, for so many years, in
the splendour of the Empire, the woollen
manufactures of Belgium underwent a decline
in the early stage of her connexion
with Holland, which she ultimately recovered,
and with such a firm success, that
the events of 1830 inflicted on it but a
momentary injury. The close of 1831, and
the years 1832, 1833 and 1834, were, on
the whole, a period of satisfactory trade.
But now commenced a struggle of every
description, and the clothing for the army
being speedily accomplished, it became essential
to look for new outlets abroad. But
just at this crisis came the consolidation
of the Zoll-Verein in Germany—the
plague, which ravaged the Levant—the
cholera, which terrified Italy—and, above
all, the commercial calamities of the United
States in 1836 and 1837, each and all of
which interfered directly with her demand;
and, to crown all, a period of depression in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the home market in 1838, and last year
arrived, simultaneously with a change in
public taste, as to the fashion of dress,
which altered the whole character of their
productions, and imposed the expense of
new machinery, and differently constructed
apparatus of all kinds. The general result
is, at present, a weighty depression, especially
in the poorer districts of Dison; and
one may sum up the recent history of the
trade by saying, that the two first years after
the separation from Holland were <i>good</i>—1834,
<i>disastrous</i>—1835 and 1836, <i>passable</i>—1837
and 1838, <i>bad</i>—and 1839, equally so.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Verviers is an open, gay looking country
town, not like the manufacturing places of
England, which are dense, red-bricked rows
of smoky houses, thickly huddled together—but
with broad, sunny streets, and handsome
white houses; the dwellings of the
proprietors and their factories, being equally
ornamented on the front next the street.
The country around it, though beautiful, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>barren, and provisions of all kinds are as
expensive in Verviers as in Brussels.</p>

<p>M. Gaudry, an intelligent proprietor of
several manufactories, to whom we brought
letters, gave a deplorable account of the
recent joint stock speculations in Belgium,
which seem to have been carried on to an
extent of capital, and with a recklessness in
management that is quite inconceivable.
Verviers was a favourite field for their operations,
owing to the variety of its resources,
which presented something to suit every appetite
of enterprise; and as works in actual
operation were much more seductive baits
for shareholders, concerns were bought up
wholesale from their proprietors at the
most extravagant rates, to be sold out again
in retail shares to the joint stock amateurs.
One coal mine, in the vicinity of the town,
which had nearly ruined its proprietor, was
greedily purchased by the projectors of one
of these schemes, making its owner’s fortune
just in time to conceal his actual
ruin, and after being worked for a short
time, ended in the bankruptcy of the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
company—but, of course, not till it had
amply rewarded the secretaries, solicitors,
and directory. A worsted manufacturer, in
like manner, who was on the verge of insolvency,
offered his mills to a joint stock
proprietary, who eagerly accepted them on
his terms—paid a sum for the concern,
which he forthwith invested in land, and
gave him a salary, for managing his own
works, more than equal to all the profits
they ever realized.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be believed, though it is
a fact, that between 1833 and 1838, one
hundred and fifty or sixty companies of this
kind, actually invested three hundred and
fifty millions of francs, or about £15,000,000,
in speculations of this kind—for insurances,
mines, machine making, public works, export
associations, glass manufactories, sugar refineries,
cotton and flax mills, printing,
brewing, in short, every imaginable undertaking
that could be described in scrip.</p>

<p>The mania originated with some similar
undertakings projected by the King of Holland,
but which being prudently conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
were moderately successful. But never was
theory more vividly exemplified, in practice,
than were the warnings of Adam Smith
realized in the case of the Belgium companies;
without either of his two essentials to
success—“monopoly or defined and limited
action;” they burst at once into all the pathless
wilds of speculation and extravagance.
To success in any industrial undertaking,
two things are essential, <i>mind and money</i>;
but the shareholders of a company contribute
only the latter, leaving the supply
of the former to a directory: the partners
are only called upon to <i>pay</i> and not to <i>think</i>,
so that the mass of their capital is unrepresented
by an equivalent proportion of
intellect and forethought. The <i>general</i> result
of this, is the failure that invariably accompanies
neglect, and even the works which are
undertaken are never pushed with vigour, or
expanded by new discoveries and inventions.
These are the offspring of that
anxious exertion of all the faculties of the
brain which accompanies the watchful prudence
of a man, who has his whole fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
at stake, and is dependent upon his individual
genius. But the holder of a joint-stock
share, who throws his contribution into the
general fund, and sends twice a year for his
dividend, (perhaps, without receiving it,) has
neither the information nor the interest
that are indispensable to stimulate improvements.</p>

<p>Mistakes and errors are thus constantly
occurring, and losses supervene; these, on
their first appearance, would alarm and
deter a private individual from incurring further
risk, and he would prepare, at once, to
retrieve his capital; but to the officers of a
company these occurrences are matters of
comparative indifference, so long as the last
shilling of the paid up funds remains to
meet their salaries as they fall due. And
even the proprietary themselves, though
conscious of the diminution of their profits,
do not feel it so acutely, coming as it does
off so large a fund, and are, besides, spurred
on by the spirit of rivalry to incur the
temporary loss, in order to drive some competing
company from the field, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
only to be done by the largeness of their
transactions; on the principle of the match-seller,
who lost a trifle upon every bundle,
and would be ruined were it not for the
vast extent of the business which he did.</p>

<p>The results of this system were not slow
in developing themselves in Belgium; one
by one they began to strain, break, and
give way; distrust was every hour growing
blacker, when the bank of Belgium, which
had been similarly formed in 1835, with a
capital of twenty millions of francs, and had
encouraged the establishment of some twenty
or thirty other joint-stock speculations,
with a capital of fifty millions more, suddenly
suspended payment in 1838, and
universal dismay and confusion followed;
bubbles burst in all directions, those concerns
which were unsound exploded at
once, and others more substantial suspended
their operations, and resorted to
fresh calls and loans to enable them to
proceed. In the mean time, prices and the
wages of labour had been fluctuating like
the waves of the sea under this financial tempest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
at one time raised to the highest pitch
by the demand for machinery created by
such vast simultaneous exertions, and anon
reduced below a remunerative level by the
ardour of their competition with each other.
Several of these companies still survive, but
almost universally struggling with the difficulties
in which they have involved not
only themselves, but those private individuals
whose steady and lucrative trade they
had invaded in the rage of their speculations.</p>

<p>From Verviers to Eupen, the Prussian
frontier, the road is high and uninteresting;
it speedily leaves the charming valleys of
the Vesdre behind, and comes within sight
of the ruins of Limbourg, one of the most
melancholy scenes of desolation I have seen—it
stands lonely and apart upon the summit
of a rocky eminence, the remains of
what had once been a city, now a wilderness.
Its rugged walls covered with green
moss, scarcely a roof visible, and the remnants
of its shattered fortifications flung, like
a torn banner, across the sky. It has still,
however, a few wretched inhabitants, who
are engaged in the zinc mines in its vicinity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
It seems incredible that this stranded wreck,
was once the capital of a duchy and the
residence of a sovereign.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is impossible to turn one’s back upon
this most interesting and enterprising country
without emotions of deep anxiety as to
its future destiny. Its political fortunes
would require something more than ordinary
foresight to predict, and the recent
possibility of an European war, elicited the
avowal of how slightly France would regard
the treaties of 1831 or 1839, did Belgium
stand for one moment in the way to obstruct
her designs, either of aggression or
defence. But those for whose future lot
the strongest sympathy is excited, are her
skilful artisans and her energetic and adventurous
manufacturers and merchants.
Merchants, indeed, she has but few, for nature
and providence seem to have combined
to render Belgium a workshop rather than
a warehouse. Austria, by the base desertion
of her shipping interest, in becoming
a party to the closing of the Scheldt at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
treaty of Munster, compelled her to turn
her attention inwardly upon herself, and to
seek to replace by the loom and the hammer,
that which she had lost by the annihilation
of the sail and the helm. Under France, and
with the all-powerful protection of Napoleon,
her capabilities were developed to the
fullest extent of her capital and her means,
all Europe affording a market for her commodities,
and creating a demand almost
beyond her power to supply.</p>

<p>With the events of 1815, and her annexation
to Holland, that vast outlet was
contracted to a narrower space, and the
King, on assuming the direction of his
affairs, found a nation of mechanics, whom
it became his province to provide with profitable
employment. In the attempt to do
this, it is questionable whether he did not
overstep the bounds of prudence, and lead,
by the system he adopted, to the further
development of powers which were already
simply sufficient for their functions;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>
<p class="noin">Individual enterprise was superseded rather
than assisted; and the expedients of
the government tended to injure it in one
respect by relieving it from the effects of
its own errors, feeding it with capital,
and carrying off its surplus production
through societies which purchased at a
handsome price to export at a loss. Even
with all these appliances, her resources
and powers were developed beyond the legitimate
means of their employment, and the
15,000,000 of her population and colonies,
whom Holland, compelled to give a preference
to her productions, were inadequate
to their consumption. What then must
have been her condition, when in 1830,
those 15,000,000 were reduced to something
more than three, whilst her machinery and
powers of production remained the same as
before?</p>

<p>The new government, it must be admitted
upon all hands, in spite of the murmurs
of those, the evils of whose condition
lay too deep for superficial remedies,
such as the ministry had it in their power
to apply, have left no practical expedient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
untried to afford them relief, but as yet in
vain; and the history of one year seems but
to afford a painful contrast with the greater
prosperity of that which preceded it. Money,
so far as it was available, has in no case
been spared. Mechanical and commercial
education, both theoretical and practical, has
been duly attended to; prizes and honours
have been awarded to successful industry;
and communications, both by highways,
railroads, and canals, have been lavishly
provided to invite consumption and demand;
but no government can possibly afford
the Belgians or procure for them, that
which alone can be a fundamental remedy—<i>a
market proportionate to their machinery</i>.</p>

<p>In every thing that is the offspring of
manual labour brought to bear upon native
produce, their manufactures are successful;
but so soon as they are either obliged to
bring their raw material from abroad, or to
come into competition with the machinery
of more populous countries, their advantages
suddenly disappear. Thus in iron
work in general, cutlery, ordinary machinery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
and hardware, they excel; as well
as in the production of lace and of linen
yarn, in distillation or brewing, in the
manufacture of furniture and paper, and, in
short, in all the indispensable requisites of
a home consumption. On the other hand,
their coal and their iron, though abundant,
lie deeper and dearer than those of their
most formidable rivals in Great Britain;
and copper, which is equally essential to
extensive operations in machinery, they
have none. Their trade would lose its pre-eminence
could the Irish be once induced to
adopt their processes for the preparation of
flax; their cotton manufacture is in the agonies
of dissolution, and their silk has already
departed. Their woollens, their sugar refiners,
and other once fruitful fields of enterprise
and wealth, are no longer to be relied
on; and, in a word, the whole frame-work
of their system is labouring under a plethora,
for which no ingenuity has yet sufficed to
invent an effectual relief.</p>

<p>One expedient, may, perhaps, suggest itself,
that if her manufacturing force is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
great, it should be directed into other
channels, and her powers of production
reduced into an accordance with her demand
and consumption. But, independently of
the fact, that her agriculture, which lost,
equally with her artizans, an outlet in the
colonies of Holland, is already overstocked,
and would afford no reception to her surplus
mechanics, the production of her machinery,
even if reduced within the wants of a population
of three or four millions, would still
be undersold by those of her rivals, whose
consumption extends over a vastly more
extended field. England with two hundred
millions of subjects in India and the West;
Russia with 66,000,000; Austria with half
that number; the German League with twenty-four,
and France with thirty-five millions,
would render it utterly beyond the power of
Belgium to enter any neutral market in the
world in competition with them, or even
to supply her own, unless at a sacrifice.</p>

<p>The character of the Belgians for industry,
frugality, and skill, is not surpassed by
that of any artisan in the world, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
these, unfortunately, are not the only requisites
to success. “The sufferings of the
Belgian mechanics,” says M. Briavionne,
“are all referable to their unfortunate political
position; but, formed in a school of
long adversity, they have learned to discover,
even in their misfortunes, a fountain
of higher qualities, which has sustained
them in their painful struggle. Prodigal
in prosperity, adversity has served to teach
them economy—to render them systematic,
patient, and persevering. Nurtured in
luxury, they have become reconciled to
privations; and the Belgian manufacturer
has long since learned to place his sole
reliance upon untiring labour, and unyielding
industry. Less adventurous than the
American, or the Englishman, he has more
fore-sight, moderation and patience, than
them both.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>“The condition of the population,” adds
M. Briavionne, “may be thus summarily described;—of
four millions of inhabitants, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
is in independence, (l’aisance), another in
want, (besoin), and the remainder floating
between these two points.”</i></p>

<p>But another reflection naturally forces
itself upon the mind of any one who sympathises
with the artisans of Belgium, generous,
industrious, and deserving, as they
have here been described—<i>who and what is
it that have reduced them to this condition of
suffering and privation?</i> The answer is but
too obvious; and those who were the base
instruments of their ruin, if they have not
discovered the effects of their own crime, in
the stagnation of all national prosperity,
must, long ere this, have learned it in the
“curses, not loud but deep,” with which
their actions are assailed, by their dupes
and victims. Belgium has, years ere this,
discovered the truth of the maxim, that it
is—</p>

<p>If, under the successive sovereignties of
Austria and France, and as an integral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
portion of that of Holland, she had not the
poetical satisfaction of being “a nation instead
of a province,” she had, at least, the
substantial enjoyments of liberty, wealth
and remunerative industry, blessings which
even “hereditary bondsmen” might hesitate
to exchange for bigotry, poverty and
decay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> any material change in the
general aspect of the country, a hundred
little incidental matters quickly apprize the
stranger who has crossed the Belgian frontier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
that he has passed into Prussia. The
jolting of the pavé is changed, in an instant,
for the smooth roll of macadamization:
instantaneously, instead of the French he
has been accustomed to, he is saluted in
German by the douaniers: every stake and
wooden bar about the custom-house is accurately
ring-streaked, like a barber’s pole,
only with white and black instead of crimson—and
the lumbering post boy of Belgium,
with a half Hibernian license of costume,
is replaced by the trim postilion, in his military
uniform, and trumpet slung across his
shoulder, with a profusion of worsted lace
and tassels. The aspect of the country,
too, is different, and the broad, French-like,
sweeps of hill and valley, which extend
through Limbourg, became broken up into
wide inclosures, diversified with abundance
of woods and luxuriant plantings.</p>

<p>Neither the douaniers, nor the police,
gave us the slightest inconvenience; the
former, and without any fee, accepted our
assurance that our carriage contained nothing
contraband, and did not open a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
box; the latter <i>visé’d</i> our Belgian passports
without delay, and within ten minutes from
passing under the barrier, we found ourselves
rolling quickly, over an excellent
road, to Aix-la-Chapelle. The barrier itself,
by the way, is a change from the Belgian;—a
ponderous beam of wood, painted,
as usual, in circular stripes of white and
black, rests right across the road, and
being loaded with a heavy weight at one
end, is allowed to rise upon a pivot, to
allow the traveller to drive under.</p>

<p>Throughout, not only Prussia, but Germany
in general, we found the same polite
facilities regarding passports, at every frontier
and police station at which it was necessary
to present them; and although they
were, of course, required to be formal, we
had neither delay nor annoyance in their
investigation. In fact, I am satisfied, from
my own experience, that nine-tenths of the
outcry against the “tyrannous nuisance
of passports,” on the continent, arises
from the irregularity of those who carry
them, in complying with the stated requirements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
or their absurd impatience
of a custom, in which, though it is applied
indiscriminately to all the world,
their self-importance suspects something
personal to themselves. An English gentleman
from the West Indies, who was travelling
some years ago in Switzerland,
attended by a faithful negro slave was
feelingly assured by him, when fuming at
some annoyance of the passport system in
the successive cantons, “that it was quite
evident they would find no real liberty till
they returned to Jamaica.”</p>

<p>On gaining the summit of a long hill, we
suddenly looked down upon the turrets and
domes of the venerable and imperial city of
Charlemagne, in the basin of a deep woody
amphitheatre, which rises around it on all
sides, covered with waving forests to the
very top. No situation could be imagined
more charming without anything very picturesque
or magnificent. The suburbs extend
a long way beyond the old fortifications,
and after driving past innumerable
villas and pleasant cottages, we passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
under a massy square gate surmounted by
a high slated roof, and rattled along a
coarse lumpy pavement through streets of
dirty and desolate houses, with little appearance
of either wealth, comfort, or prosperity,
on any side. The most striking
edifices are the huge hotels, which seem
still to enjoy a pretty fair share of patronage,
though Aix, like Spa, has of late
years been postponed for the baths of
Bohemia and the Rhine, and the majority
of the travellers whom we meet in the
streets are only on the wing, hastening to
or returning from a visit to its more distant
rivals.</p>

<p>Under the German empire, Aix-la-Chapelle
possessed sufficient resources within
itself, to enable it to support the dignity of
a free imperial city. Its woollen manufactures
were long famous in Europe, and
the manufacture of cloth is still one of its
most lucrative employments. Coals are
abundant in its vicinity, and it has likewise
an extensive trade in the construction
of machinery, which was introduced here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
by one of the ubiquitous Cockerills of
Seraing. He experienced, however, in 1830,
an ungenerous return for all his enterprise,
his house and premises being one day
sacked and plundered by a band of mutinous
rioters. The population of Aix-la-Chapelle
are eminently Catholic, and its
working population swelled by perpetual
emigrations from Verviers and Liege, were
inspired with the utmost sympathy for the
proceedings of the patriots of the Belgian
revolution. Their character, however, was of
the worst description, and a love of plunder
contended with a love of country in the
composition of their patriotism. The intelligence
of the three days of July at Paris,
had warmed this double enthusiasm to a
dangerous glow, but when upon this revolution
supervened the three days of September
at Brussels, their generous ardour
in the cause of liberty was no longer to be
restrained within common bounds; and, at
length, one evening, on the arrival of the
diligence from Liege with tricolor cockades
on the horses’ heads, the latent fires of freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
burst forth; even the strong walls of
the prison could not restrain the patriotic
ardour of its inmates, who being enlarged
by their generous countrymen immediately
shared with them the benefits of their
previous observations, and leading them to
the most promising spots for helping themselves,
they proceeded amidst animating
cries of “<i>Vive les Belges!</i>” and “<i>Vive la
liberté!</i>” to divide the furniture and dispose
of the stocks in trade of the wealthier inhabitants
and shopkeepers.</p>

<p>Mr. Cockerill being most obnoxious as a
manufacturer, who gave extensive employment
to the poor, and had his mansion furnished
with a degree of intolerable elegance
and comfort, was speedily taught the incompatibility
of such habits and enjoyments
with the principles of genuine liberty; and
in the course of a few hours, the contents of
his residence, valued at 50,000 dollars, disappeared,
and along with it the liberators took
charge of his money, consisting of 135,000
francs in bank-notes, and 25,000 more in
silver and gold. The progress of the patriots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
was, however, checked by the appearance
of their vulgar enemies, the police; a hundred
and twenty of whom, under the command
of a despot, named Brendamour,
prevented the torch of freedom from taking
its “radiant ground,” and by a few discharges
of musketry amongst the “liberators,”</p>

<p class="noin">Some forty or fifty “lofty spirits” were
disenthralled by this volley of the burgher
guards, several others were wounded and
made prisoners, but a vast number escaped
across the frontiers, to unite with their
kindred hearts in Belgium; and seventy,
who were tried on the insulting imputation
of robbery and incendiarism, were basely
condemned by the Prussian authorities to
undergo the inglorious punishments awarded
to such offences. So ended the revolution
of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>Aix-la-Chapelle is still a venerable old
city, especially when seen from a distance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and its very name is connected with imperial
ideas; Charlemagne and his chivalry,
Kings, Emperors and Popes, wars,
congresses and treaties, all of which have,
at one time or another, been associated with
its name. But it has now few objects of
great interest within itself—its interest is
with the past. Its Dom Kirke, <i>the</i> chapel
whence the ancient city of Achen derived
its appellation, to distinguish it from others
of the same name in Savoy and Provence,
like some relic from the sea encrusted with
shells and parasites, is scarcely discernible
in the midst of the coatings of modern
buildings with which it is shut up and enveloped,—a
confused agglomeration of styles,
Gothic, Saxon, Byzantine and Moresco. But
the central dome, the nucleus of the entire
building, and that portion said to have been
originally selected to cover in the Emperor’s
tomb, stand still erect and firm, no doubt
in consequence of perpetual repairs and
restorations, “a thousand years roll over
it in vain,” and it exhibits, unquestionably,
the oldest specimen of Saxon architecture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
in the world. It had been originally a
simple domed octagon, with arched windows
in each of its sides, and surrounded within
by a gallery, sustained by pillars of porphery,
from the Palace of the Exarch of
Ravenna, which were carried hither by
Charlemagne. These are at least identical—they
have survived the ravage of
the Normans, and all the subsequent
ravages of Germany till the French
greedy</p>

<blockquote><p>
To rive what Goth and Turk, and Time had spared, 
</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">carried them off to Paris, and as only a
portion of them were ever returned, they
have not yet relieved the white-washed
columns by which they were replaced.</p>

<p>Other chapels have, at various times,
been run out from the sides of the
ancient centre, so that the whole is now
an informal and confused mass, but
without anything striking or magnificent,
unless it be the large windows of the
choir built about five hundred years ago,
which as they rise from the foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
quite to the vaulted roof give it the
appearance of a gigantic conservatory. Suspended
in the midst of the choir is a crown
for the Virgin, the gift of Queen Mary of
Scotland, and in various parts of the
church are hung a greater profusion of
those votive models of broken limbs and
infant’s marks than I have seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>These offerings often accompany the
prayers for the recovery of the object represented,
or are hung up in grateful commemoration
of the event—may not the singular
custom be referable to the incident
of the Philistines recorded by Samuel, when
in order to get rid of the emerods and the
plague of mice with which they were afflicted,
they were directed by “the priests
and diviners” to make five golden emerods
and six golden mice according to the
number of their cities and their lords, and
to offer them for a trespass-offering for
having taken the ark captive, “for one
plague was upon them and upon their
lords.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span></p>

<p>But the most solemn object in “that
ancient oratory” is the huge black flag
that closes down the tomb of Charlemagne—it
lies under the centre of the gigantic
dome, beneath a huge gilded candelabrum,
a gift of the Emperor Barbarossa, designed
to burn above the grave of the conqueror
which, bears the brief but sublime
inscription in brazen letters sunk in the
solid stone “CAROLO MAGNO.” An
extraordinary incident is connected with
this impressive sepulchre. The Emperor,
Otto III, two hundred years after the
death of Charlemagne, caused the stone
to be lifted and descended into the sepulchre
of the buried monarch—he found
him not prostrate in decay, but seated
upon a throne of marble, covered with
bosses of gold—the crown upon his bony
brow—the royal dalmatic robe around
his fleshless shoulders—his right hand resting
on the sword, which the song of the
troubadours has immortalized as the “<i>irrésistible
Joyeuse</i>,” and in his left the sceptre
and the orb, the emblems of a dominion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
which was co-extensive with the globe itself.
The pilgrims pouch which he had borne in
life as an emblem of humility was still
hanging from his girdle, and on his knees
an illuminated transcript of the gospels.
The Emperor removed the regalia to Nuremberg,
whence they were afterwards
transferred to Vienna, and there in the imperial
jewel chamber in the Schweitzer-Hof,
are still to be seen the royal paraphernalia
of Charlemagne, the crown set with rude
uncut gems, such as may rarely be referred
to a period a thousand years ago. The
body was replaced in a sarcophagus of alabaster
in the tomb, but, has long since disappeared,
and the marble chair on which
it was seated, is still shown in one of the alcoves
of the gallery above.</p>

<p>This striking incident suggested the following
lines, which were given to me by a
Lady, with whose exquisite productions the
public are already familiar—Mrs. Alaric
A. Watts. They have not before appeared
in type.</p>

<p>Aix-la-Chapelle, as a city, is, as I have
said, eminently Catholic, and the minster is
at all times crowded with devotees, and objects
of the most pitiable deformity. The
“treasury” of the Cathedral too, is surprisingly
rich in relics, girdles of the virgin, the
napkin in which Herodias’ daughter received
the head of John the Baptist, Aron’s rod, a
stick of the true cross, some genuine manna
from the wilderness, and a whole inventory
of such other trumpery as are usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
to be found in these pious “marine
stores.” Still the Dom Kirke is a most
interesting spot, for there is a sufficiency of
reality about it, to connect its present condition
with the past.</p>

<p>Not far from the minster is one of those
atrocious bagnios, the disgrace and disgust
of continental watering places, a licensed
hell—to the modified credit of Prussia, it
is the <i>only one</i> in her dominions, and tolerated
only on the humiliating representation,
that were it abolished, our countrymen
and others would utterly desert the baths
of Aix-la-Chapelle, for the more distant
Brunnens of Nassau and Baden, which
would still continue the dishonoring attraction.
The inhabitants themselves, however,
and the officers of the garrison are
strictly forbidden to cross the threshold—a
striking rebuke to the crowds of strangers
who frequent it. It seems to be a spacious
building with no external attractions, and
the lower story occupied by fancy shops
and booksellers.</p>

<p>The Hôtel de Ville a remarkable, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
now almost ruinous old building, is said to
occupy the site of the birth place of Charlemagne,
and one of the lofty towers embedded
in the building is ascribed to the
Romans, whose bathing propensities found
a thousand allurements in the hot springs
of this beautiful valley. The interior contains
a series of halls and saloons, in which
congresses have been held, and treaties of
peace negociated at various times, during the
last century and the present, including that
of 1818, when the allied armies were withdrawn
from France. Its walls, covered with
frescoes and its ceilings once richly stuccoed
are now dropping into dust and decay,
and the prestige of antiquity is destroyed by
converting it into the bureau of the police,
at the door of which a crowd of impatient
English, were muttering “curses not loud
but deep,” upon the vexations of the passport
system.</p>

<p>In the little square opposite it, stands a
fountain of stone, surmounted by the bronze
statue of Charlemagne, which has afforded
a model for so many of his portraits, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
in armour, crowned, and with the orb
in one hand and his renowned falchion in
the other. This work of art received as
usual, the sterling mark of the French virtuosi,
by performing the pilgrimage to the
Louvre. On either side of the fountain are
two pedestals each supporting a huge bronze
eagle.</p>

<p>Aix, as a halting place for invalids, may
be a sufficiently agreeable spot for a temporary
stay, the air from its situation must
be mild and healthful, and the views around
it are in every way charming. The merits
and virtues of its waters, whatever they are,
are of course as salubrious now as before
the revolution of fashion, and the hills
around it abound in agreeable and healthful
excursions. The obelisk on the Louisberg
rising immediately above the city, which
was raised by Napoleon to commemorate his
victories, was upturned by the Cossacks in
search of the coins which they understood
it to be the custom to deposit in the foundation
of such erections, but was restored by
the King of Prussia, and its vaunting inscriptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
obliterated. The little village of
Borcette or Burscheid, at the foot of the
hill opposite the Louisberg, and about
half a mile from the city gates, is
another cockneyfied lounge of the citizens
and invalids, with mathematical flower-beds
and gravel walks in right angles
and parallels. At all these places are
to be found the usual pastimes, theatres,
music-bands, bazaars, cafés, dancing, and
all the unmeaning <i>petits jeus</i> of a watering
place.</p>

<p>Aix-la-Chapelle is the capital of the
Trans-Rhenan provinces, conferred upon
Prussia at the Congress of Vienna, when
they were taken out of that symmetrical
boundary, which Napoleon had taught
France, to look to as the natural frontier
of her dominions. If no other consideration
weighed with the allied sovereigns in
forming the kingdom of the Netherlands,
than the erection of a controlling state
upon the north of France; a glance at the
map might suggest to geographical politicians
the singularity of connecting Prussia by
one straggling line, with France on the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
hand and Prussia on the other, and the
greater propriety of having added these
provinces to augment the importance of the
newly-erected state, to whose manufacturing
interests, the boon of an additional million
and a half of consumers, would have been
an important acquisition. It is just probable
that such a disposition might have
given it greater permanence, though it
would have been by establishing from the
first a preponderance of the Roman Catholic
party to the prejudice of the Dutch Protestants.
As it is, however, the feelings of
the people themselves, so far as my enquiries
were accurately answered, are those
of perfect contentment with their present
position; and the firm but temperate resolution
of the late King, Prussia has as yet
been perfectly successful in satisfying them
as to the nature of their real interests.
The absurd and drunken riots I have alluded
to in 1830, and the contumacious
audacity of the Archbishop of Cologne two
years back, are the only instances I have
heard of disaffection or insubordination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span></p>

<p>We <span class="err" title="original: staid">stayed</span> during our visit to Aix-la-Chapelle
at an admirable hotel, the “Grand
Monarque,” large enough to lodge a whole
hospital of invalids, whether suffering from
one or other of the “maladies Anglaises,”
consumption or ennui. In the morning when
we were to take our departure for Dusseldorff,
we found, after waiting an hour for
the arrival of our horses from the posting
office, that the waiter over night had neglected
his instructions to order them,
when a delay of nearly an hour had to take
place till our passports could be sent to the
chief of the department and the error rectified.</p>

<p>An admirable regulation prevails throughout
the entire of Germany with regard to
posting, which might, with the best effect,
be introduced in England, and without any
government interference in the affair. Before
starting, the post master, who is an
officer of the crown, delivers to the traveller
a printed form signed by himself, and specifying
the items of every charge for the
stage he is setting out upon, the distance,
the number of horses, the mileage, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
tolls; this, if erroneous, is corrected on the
spot, and the stranger is thus freed from all
wrangling or apprehension of imposture.
The posting tariff, at the same time, regulates
the “<i>trinkgelt</i>,” the fee of the postillion,
which is but five silver groschen, or
six-pence for a German mile containing four
and two-thirds English; but this the traveller
is expected, though he must not be <i>solicited</i>
to exceed, provided he is satisfied with the
performance of his post-boy, and in general
double the amount, or at the utmost three-half-pence
per mile will excite a lively gratitude.</p>

<p>The face of the country, between Aix-la-Chapelle
and the Rhine, without being picturesque
in any degree, is proverbially rich
and luxuriant, especially the ancient Duchy
of Juliers, now extinguished, which surrounds
the fortified city of the same name.
Every town and village we passed through
was but a congregation of agricultural dwellings—every
building was converted into
a barn—and even from the windows of some
ruinous towers, we saw the projecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
sheaves of the early harvest, which had
been already gathered in.</p>

<p>Juliers, where we breakfasted, is a fortified
city, built in the midst of an apparently
swampy level, but so begirt and encompassed
with ramparts and fosses, that it is said to be
impregnable to every assault but that of
starvation. We drove over drawbridges
and under covered ways without end; the
passage winding from side to side, till it
seemed to issue in the opposite direction
from that at which it entered the side of the
fortification, and we halted for an excellent
breakfast at a most unpromising inn, the
“Drei Königen,” in the centre of the town,
which as Juliers is the highway to Dusseldorff
and Cologne, was beset by diligences
and calèches of every conceivable
shape and model. Juliers has no trade,
and its sole support seems to be the regular
victualling of a garrison of 3,000 Prussians,
and the almost equally regular reception
of twice as many English tourists
on wing to the Rhine, or returning from
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span></p>

<p>Between Juliers and Neuss, on the banks
of the river, we scarcely saw an acre of
pasture land or meadow, all seemed to be
under cultivation, and the wonder is, where
they find fodder for their cattle, unless they
have been effectually weaned off all appreciation
of grass or clover. Neuss is a bustling,
industrious little community of some
four or five thousand inhabitants, busily engaged
in the manufacture of linen and woollen
cloth, and having numerous mills for an
operation that I am surprised is not attempted
in Ireland, the crushing of vegetable
oils. At a time when the capture of
whales is said to be becoming most precarious,
and the demand is increased beyond
expectation by the augmentation of
machinery and the increase of railroads,
which seem to have more than counterbalanced
the introduction of gas, it would
surely be found as lucrative in the rich soil
of Ireland as that of Flanders or the Rhine,
to grow hemp and colza with a view to express
the oil for the consumption. A windmill,
such as one sees thousands of in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Holland and Belgium, with all the machinery
for this purpose, can be put up, I
understand, for £150, or even less.</p>

<p>Neuss is mentioned by Tacitus as Novesium,
and Drusus is said to have constructed
a bridge across the Rhine above
the town, at the same spot where there is
now a swinging bridge to convey passengers
to Dusseldorff. It has a very remarkable
church, the steeple of which serves as a
pedestal for a large and spirited statue of
St. Quirinus, who with an unfurled flag
in his hand, performs double duty as its
patron and weather-cock. The building
itself is of some Saxon or Norman architecture,
closely resembling that of Charlemagne
at Aix-la-Chapelle, and underneath it is a
singular crypt, with groined arches, supported
by low truncated columns, and having
altogether an air of the remotest antiquity.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half from the town,
we drove upon the platform of the swinging
bridge, along with a crowd of horses,
cattle and foot passengers, and in less than
five minutes were carried over by the mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
action of the rapid current to the opposite
side, where a drive of another mile or two
through gardens and suburbs, brought us
to the Breitenbacher-Hof, in the central
square of Dusseldorff.</p>

<p class="center">COMPARATIVE PRICES OF MACHINERY IN BELGIUM AND
IN GREAT BRITAIN.</p>

<p>As the question of permitting the free export of machinery from
this country, occupies at present much of the attention of the British
legislature, and its policy cannot be safely estimated without a knowledge
of the comparative rates at which the same article can be produced
on the continent and with us—in other words, what advantage the mill-owners
and manufacturers of Great Britain enjoy, at the present moment,
in the outlay for the erection of their works—I have been at some pains to
ascertain its relative value in Belgium and in Manchester, and the following
extracts, of the prices at the Phœnix works of Ghent, is contrasted
with the cost of the same articles in England, as furnished to me by

<p class="center">INSTRUCTIONS<br>
 
<small>FOR THE</small><br>
 
<span class="large">CULTIVATION OF FLAX,</span><br>
 
<small>AND THE</small><br>
 
PREPARATION OF LINEN,<br>
 
<i>Circulated amongst the Peasantry of Flanders, 
by the Société Linière of Brussels</i>.</p>
 
<p class="center">(TRANSLATED FROM THE FLEMISH ORIGINAL). 
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the information collected in France, in Lille and in
Paris, one important fact can be deduced, that Belgium <i>may</i>
preserve her incontestible superiority in the linen manufacture;
but that to do so, she must, more than ever, make
it a point to manufacture goods of that sterling and solid
quality, to which she owes her reputation. We have, in
consequence, to request all the committees of the different
districts of the Association to unite with us in awakening
the attention of the growers, the spinners, the manufacturers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the bleachers, and those who finish the linen and
make it up, each in his own department, and to bring under
their notice every point in which it may be possible to improve
the old systems.</p>

<p>It is particularly necessary that every means should be
adopted to bring it specially before the manufacturers, that
it is impossible they can preserve our interesting manufacture
in its ancient splendour, unless they give the most constant
care to make a better and more solid article than the
manufacturers of other countries, and that they cannot continue
to attract foreign merchants to our markets, unless
they rigorously abstain from any fraud or deception.</p>

<p>Sometimes the teeth of the reeds are at unequal distances;
again, acids of a corroding nature are used in the process of
bleaching the yarn, to the detriment of the quality. It is
necessary to convince those who may co-operate in frauds
of this nature, or in any deception whatever, that in doing
an injury to the nation, in the national manufacture, they
are injuring themselves; and that, on the other hand, those
who may assist in re-establishing the ancient renown of
Belgium in the manufacture of linen, will be the first to
reap its fruits.</p>

<p>With this end, and to lay the foundation for the accomplishment
of this object, we now submit the following observations,
which have been suggested by a voyage in Germany,
in which minute attention was paid to the different processes
of manufacture, as practised in that country. We
recommend them to the serious attention of all the spinners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
manufacturers and merchants, and will eagerly receive from
them any ideas or information, which experience may enable
them to transmit to us, to aid in the compilation of definitive
instructions.</p>

<h4>CULTURE OF THE FLAX.</h4>

<p>In the districts of Courtrai, St. Nicholas, and Tournai, flax
is cultivated in perfection, but nowhere else is the cultivation
what could be wished. Thus, the culture of flax has increased,
without the art of cultivation making any progress.
The quality of the flax, even the abundance of the crop,
depends much upon the selection of the seed. In general,
the seed which we import from the North, succeeds, but
for a few years past, the merchants engaged in the business
have taken advantage of the confidence reposed in them by
the farmers. What they sold as genuine Riga seed, was,
really a mixture. Thus, in several districts where it was
sown, the crop sprang up but partially and imperfectly.
The committee will take measures to give the farmer more
security in his purchases, and adopt means to import direct
genuine Riga seed.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that when the seed is sown early, as
soon as the season permits germination, the crop is always better,
both in quantity and quality. Experience, also, teaches
that good tillage and abundance of manure, have a great
influence on the quality of the crop. The spade should be
used in preference to the plough, as it pulverizes the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
better. This it is which makes it so difficult to cultivate
flax in large quantities, and in a number of acres together.</p>

<p>On the fineness of the stalk, depends the fineness of the
fibre. To obtain, therefore, fine flax, the seed must be
sown very thickly, which can only be done where the soil is
well manured and properly tilled.</p>

<p>It has been proved that when the flax is pulled between
the falling of the flower and the formation of the seed, the
fibre is finer and more solid than at any other time, so that
unless it is wished to sacrifice the quality of the flax to obtain
seed, the former must not await the full maturity of the
latter.</p>

<p>Above all things the rotation of crops must be scrupulously
observed; if seven or eight years be allowed to elapse
before again sowing flax in the same field, it is certain that
there will be a good crop; but the less the interval between
the two crops, the less is the second to be calculated on
either for quality or weight.</p>

<p>We need not observe how necessary it is to the production
of good flax, that the weeding of the fields should be
attended to with great care.</p>

<h4>WATERING.</h4>

<p>In Belgium this process is conducted under two different
systems. At Courtrai, when pulled, it is allowed to dry on
the field, and is kept over all winter before steeping. In
this district, as is well known, the flax is steeped in the clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and running waters of the Lys, where it is perfectly pure
from any slime or mud.</p>

<p>In the Flanders district (Pays de Waes), the flax is
steeped immediately after pulling, being put in the water
whilst still green, the water used being stagnant. We
think that in general the preference must be given to the
system employed in Flanders; firstly, because it is difficult
to find such a river as the Lys, where the waters are so free
from any filth; and secondly, because the flax when steeped
before it dries is softer and more mellow, and the fibre is
whiter, not having that yellow tint which is always found in
flax that has been dried. The linens which we saw in Germany
were of a pure and silvery white, and the system pursued
there in steeping is that of Flanders. It was pointed
out to us that the fibre of flax which had been dried is
equally strong, but that it is harder and more yellow.
Steeping in the manner followed in Flanders demands great
care and attention, and a particular knowledge of the process.
As it is not possible for us to explain all the details, we
will confine ourselves to requesting the district committees
to send us from Flanders some persons competent to give
all the instructions necessary for performing it with success.</p>

<p>After the steeping, it is found to improve the quality to
keep the flax for a long time in the straw. The older the
flax is the better it is. If before it had any faults; if, for
example, it had been spotted, and a bad colour from being
badly exposed, it becomes equalized and uniform by remaining
for a long time in the straw heaped together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span></p>

<p>It is good to keep over the flax before spinning it, not
only in the straw, but after scutching, and even after hackling.
The Germans attach great importance to having
a soft and silky fibre. To this end they beat the flax
after it is scutched, they rub it with an iron comb without
teeth, and they are especially careful to let it grow old,
either in straw or after it has been scutched.</p>

<h4>SPINNING.</h4>

<p>As a general and incontestible rule, it is necessary in order
to make good yarn, to proportion the quality of the flax to
the description of yarn to be spun. If fine yarn be produced
from flax of an inferior quality, the quality of the yarn, and
necessarily the cloth, will be bad. It is then a very prejudicious
idea, that with any kind of flax, fine yarn can be
produced. It is equally necessary to hackle the flax, according
to the fineness and quality of the yarn to be spun.
The finer and better the yarn to be produced, the more
should the tow be separated from the solid fibres. Great
care should be given to the process of spinning—it is the
fingers that spin, the wheel only twists. The length of the
fibre contributes much to the solidity of the yarn, it is,
therefore, important to place the flax upon the distaff so
that the spinner can always take the fibre by the end, and
not by the middle. This observation has been made in
France, in the neighbourhood of Valenciennes and Cambrai,
where the good yarn for lace is produced. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
spinning wheel should be adapted to the description of the
yarn to be produced, the smaller the <i>wheel</i>, the more open
and flat will be the yarn. The larger it is, the more the
yarn is round and twisted. There is this distinction to
make between warp and weft, that the former requires to
be more twisted than the latter. To make good cloth,
the thread of the warp should be round, that of the weft
flat and open. Yarn for thread should be more twisted than
the other descriptions. This is the reason that at Lempleuve
wheels of great diameter, and turned by three cords,
are used.</p>

<p>At a moment in which mill-spun yarn, the rival production
to hand-spun yarn, lays claim to a superiority, which
it bases upon the uniform equality of its thread, the hand-spinners
must strain every nerve to attain this equality. It
is essential that they avoid, as much as possible, any knots
or lumps in the yarn, that they extract any particles of tow
their fingers may meet. We could also recommend that
the operation may be conducted with extreme cleanliness,
that any stains of oil, coal, &amp;c., be avoided, or anything
which may be difficult to remove in the bleaching. The
Germans beat their yarn a good deal before weaving it, to
render it more soft and supple, they affirm that they thereby
improve the quality of the cloth. According to them, the
softer and more yielding the yarn, the firmer and more solid
will be the cloth when bleached, it has not the disadvantage
of being too hard and stiff, and, therefore, fraying at the
folds. The system may be the object of experiment. It is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
also, useful to prepare the yarn by boiling it in a solution of
alkali, and by soaking it in milk. Ashes from beech wood
are to be preferred to those from ash. This is at least the
result of their experience in Germany. We submit the observation
to our merchants and manufacturers, to induce
them to make a trial, and to communicate to us afterwards
the result. The use of any chemical agent in bleaching
must be rigorously abstained from, their use has been constantly
prohibited by our ancient laws, and even by royal
edicts.</p>

<h4>WEAVING.</h4>

<p>The piece of cloth should be throughout uniform in
fabric, and in colour. It is then indispensable, as well for
the weft as for the warp, to use yarn from the same description
of flax. There must be none of those dry and
dead fibres, so that they do not disappear in the bleaching.</p>

<p>The warp and the weft should be as much as possible
each spun from the same specimen.</p>

<p>Numerous complaints are raised against the manufacturers
of reeds and against the weavers; the latter do
not give sufficient attention to the weaving, and some of
them use fraudulent means. Thus the reeds have sometimes
not the sufficient number of teeth; again, sometimes
one part of the web is well, and another badly woven, with,
as regards the number of threads and the workmanship.
Frauds of this kind are pointed out at nearly every market;
they were formerly punished by regulations of police, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
these preventive measures exist but in a few of the markets,
and there incompletely. It would be well that the municipal
administrations, who have public markets of linen,
would revive them vigorously to give again confidence to
the trade. We will, hereafter, give the details of these old
laws. The measure to be taken relative to the regulations
for the weaving are under the consideration of the direction
of the committee and the consul general; they are seeking
means to put a stop to the fraudulent manufactures which
unfortunately have been numerous of late years, and which
would end, after having ruined the commerce, by entirely
destroying the manufacture, and taking away from the
country an important source of occupation and existence.</p>

<p>It is still complained of some weavers that they neglect
the care of cleanliness: they should bear in mind that cloth
stained with oil, or of which the warp has been dressed with
any greasy substance, as is commonly the case, cannot be
perfectly bleached.</p>

<p>Another complaint against many weavers is, that they use
pumice stone to give a gloss to the cloth, not remarking
that it injures it considerably.</p>

<p>In Germany they do not employ mill spun yarn, it is
there considered that it can only produce bad cloth.</p>

<p>It is quite necessary to improve the construction of the
looms; when a loom is straight and well placed, a woman
can manage it as easily as a man. With a good loom more
work can be done per day. The most essential part to
observe is, that the part which drives the weft should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
always horizontal. Soon each of the District Committee
will have a loom on a new model, so that they may show
it to all the weavers. The director of the committee has
caused some looms to be brought from Bielefield, he is, at
the same time, engaged in improving the one in general use,
which he thinks is defective in many parts. On this subject
the District Committee are requested to assist the
director by sending from their respective districts a dexterous
mechanic to give his opinion on the proposed improvements.</p>

<p>For the sizing of the warp, the Germans use a paste made
of flour, the same as we do. In general they employ <i>rye
flour</i> for plain linen, but very carefully sifted. For fancy or
damask cloth they use wheat flour. We may again remark
that they pay great attention to the sifting, so that no seed
may be in the paste. The work-rooms should be suitable
to the quality of the work, better lit and consequently more
airy. The workmen have every thing to gain in preserving
a precious health for their family; a robust man can do
more work than an invalid. In Germany the work-rooms
contain four looms with ease, and are lit by glass windows
the same as the shops in our towns. We remind all that
when a work-room is well arranged, and when everything
is in its place, the work is done with more perfection, more
regularity, and, finally, with more economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span></p>

<h4>BLEACHING.</h4>

<p>The Germans pay great attention to the first washing of
the linen, in which they use a fluted beetle, fixed so as to
rub the cloth, without striking it or bruising it too rudely.
They shun all chemical agents, they use water from the
purest sources, and constantly renew it. The sizing is
effected with a starch, made at Cologne. We brought a
sample of it, which we keep for the inspection of all; it is
thought to be of a better quality than ours; and I am inclined
to believe, that it is to the superior starch that the
German linens owe their silky gloss. The drying is effected
in lofts, well constructed and spacious, where the cloth is
protected as well from the sun as from the rain. They employ
rollers for stretching and turning the linen, which make
every movement easy. We desire to see our bleachers
imitate the Germans in the care which they bestow on the
details of the operations which we have just examined.</p>

<h4>CALENDERING.</h4>

<p>No one is ignorant that, with us, this process is far from
perfect. We must, then, call the attention of those who
practice it, to the improvements that their machines call for.
On this subject, the Director is ready to communicate all
the ideas he has gathered. The calender or mangle which
the Germans use, is sixty feet long, eight or nine broad, and
fifteen high. A box, filled with stones, supported by two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
wooden cylinders, of six or seven inches in diameter, is
moved backward and forward, alternately, upon a wooden
plank, perfectly level; the linen is rolled round the wooden
cylinders, and remains there for a quarter of an hour. This
system gives a flat finish, the cloth being dry, and passing
without heat.</p>

<p>At Bielefield there exists another machine, called “the
English Beetling Machine,” by which a rounder finish is
obtained than by the calender, and which increases, momentarily,
at least, the width of the cloth. In this operation,
the linen, when dried and folded, is placed on a table of polished
stone, and beetled by heavy mallets.</p>

<h4>ATTENTION PAID TO THE SALE.</h4>

<p>To facilitate the sale of their linens, the Germans think
themselves obliged to resort to the seduction of the fold,
the envelope, and even the colour of the paper. We can
affirm, that attention to all these little points, produces excellent
results.</p>

<h3>No. III.</h3>

<p class="center">PETITION<br>

<small>OF THE</small>

COTTON MANUFACTURERS AND CALICO PRINTERS
OF BELGIUM
<br>
<small>TO THE</small>

CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>December 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="center">A MESSIEURS LES MEMBRES DE LA CHAMBRE DES
REPRÉSENTANTS.</p>

<p>Le 10 Septembre 1835, la Chambre des Représentants,
dont faisait déjà partie la majorité de l’assemblée actuelle,
a déclaré que l’Industrie Cotonnière dans sa généralité,
n’était pas suffisamment protégée. Cette déclaration a
été faite après enquête et discussion. Tout aussitôt le
Ministre des finances a promis de présenter un projet de
loi qui remplirait le vœu que la législature venait d’émettre;
et chacun dès-lors se tint dans l’attente de la mesure promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>Quatre années sont maintenant écoulées; il n’a plus été
question ni du projet du Ministre, ni de la déclaration de la
Chambre, de cette déclaration qui pourtant renfermait un
projet de haute sollicitude et que l’on ne rappelle ici que
comme un témoignage de la prévoyance, qui animait cette
assemblée lorsqu’elle fut appelée à se prononcer sur la
situation et l’avenir de l’une des branches de travail les
plus importantes du pays.</p>

<p>En effet, Messieurs les Réprésentants, ce qui s’est passé
depuis le jour, où a été donné ce témoignage d’intérêt,
et la situation présente, tout vient à l’appui du jugement
qui a été porté dans votre enceinte. Tout a renforcé
l’opinion alors émise. Veuillez en être juges: Au milieu
de l’immense élan que la production manufacturière a prise
en Belgique, à compter de 1835, l’Industrie Cotonnière
s’est consumée en efforts inutiles pour participer à ce
mouvement. En 1835, 1836, 1837, et 1838, sa production
s’est élevée un peu au-dessus des années 1831, 1832,
1833 et 1834, mais elle n’a pu retrouver l’importance que
l’année 1829 et le commencement de 1830 lui avaient
donnée. Elle est restée à la seconde époque, surtout quant
aux résultats, beaucoup au-dessous de la première. Nous
sommes à même d’en fournir la preuve par des documents
incontestables.</p>

<p>Et cependant depuis 1835 de nouveaux capitaux ont été
versés dans l’Industrie Cotonnière, sans doute parce qu’il
semblait à chacun que le gouvernement ne pouvait différer
longtemps de se conformer à la politique commerciale que<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
lui avaient tracée les Chambres en plusieurs circonstances,
et notamment dans la séance du 10 Septembre. A compter
de cette époque, les procédés des filateurs et des imprimeurs
furent améliorés, renouvelés en partie; des voyages d’observation
entrepris à l’étranger pour mettre le pays quant
aux méthodes et aux machines au niveau de ses concurrents.
Et remarquez-le bien, Messieurs les Représentants,
ces dépenses ont été faites, non dans des espérances de
bénéfices, il ne nous a pas été possible d’en faire; mais
nous agissions dans un esprit de conservation; c’est pour
l’intérêt de notre existence même que nous faisions ces
efforts. Et c’est ce qui explique comment le nombre des
Power-Looms s’est considérablement accru.</p>

<p>C’est aussi ce qui explique les perfectionnements de
détail introduits dans les filatures et dans les fabriques
d’impressions. Plus d’une fois, ceux-là même qui obéissant
à des préventions inspirées par des doctrines creuses
et subversives de toute prospérité, se sont constitués les
adversaires de l’Industrie Cotonnière, l’ont reconnu; seulement
ils ont prétendu en tirer argument contre nous. Ils
ont dit que toutes ces améliorations étaient un indice de
prospérité; qu’elles allaient ouvrir la voie à de nouveaux
profits; qu’ainsi le régime douanier auquel est soumise
notre branche d’industrie était excellent; qu’il fallait se
garder d’y porter atteinte. On n’a malheureusement que
trop obéi à ces inspirations!</p>

<p>Les faits, mais des faits irrécusables détruisent de fond en
comble ces chimériques assertions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span></p>

<p>De 1829 à 1838, l’Industrie Cotonnière a suivi en Angleterre,
en France, en Allemagne, aux Etats-Unis, une
marche ascensionnelle accablante pour notre pays, lors-qu’on
la compare à l’état dans lequel nous sommes restés.
L’accroissement roule de 50 à 75 p. c., suivant des calculs
officiels que nous publierons plus tard. Et malgré l’influence
que l’accroissement de la population a du avoir
sur la consommation intérieure, la Belgique est en 1838,
au-dessous de la production de 1829; au-dessous non
seulement pour les profits, ceci est hors de doute, mais
même pour l’importance.</p>

<p>Permettez-nous d’appeler votre attention sur d’autres
circonstances de détail, mais qui vont rendre notre démonstration
plus frappante.</p>

<p>Il y avait à Bruxelles en 1830, quatre filatures de premier
ordre en activité. En 1839, il n’en reste qu’une et
celle-là même ne marche pas encore.</p>

<p>De plus, quatre filatures de second ordre ont dans le
même temps disparu de cette localité. Parmi les propriétaires
de ces établissements, ceux qui ne sont pas tombés
en déconfiture, out profité d’incendies qui sont venus
dévorer leurs fabriques, pour se retirer d’une industrie où
l’expérience est inutile et où le travail semble à tout jamais
condamné à la plus désolante stérilité. Il faut toutefois
excepter celle de messieurs Prévinaire et Seny, filatures de
6000 broches, passée à la Hollande, et cela en 1836, à l’époque
même où l’on soutient que dans notre pays cette
branche d’industrie prospérait. Qui pourrait voir rien de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
volontaire dans de pareils déplacements, dans de semblables
liquidations? Comment affirmer que des faits de cette
nature ne cachent rien de désastreux?</p>

<p>A la face du pays et la main sur la conscience, nous
déclarons que l’Industrie Cotonnière a constamment langui
depuis 1830. Notre intime conviction est qu’elle est
atteinte d’un mal organique, sous lequel elle succombe
lentement; elle marche à sa ruine; et la cause principale
existe dans l’inexécution de la politique commerciale tracée
par vous.</p>

<p>Essayera-t-on encore de combattre cette vérité? On
n’a déjà entassé que trop de sophismes et de mensonges
pour l’obscurcir. L’industrie Cotonnière souffre et dépérit,
a-t-on dit, la faute en est aux fabricants qui ne savent pas
profiter des avantages que notre position topographique
leur offre et qui refusent d’exploiter les débouchés qui leur
sont ouverts.—Vous ne le croirez pas, Messieurs les Représentants.
Il vous répugnera d’admettre que des fabricants
vieillis dans l’étude de leur profession et dans la pratique
des affaires commerciales, soient capables de repousser avec
une stupide opiniâtreté les occasions de profit qu’ils auraient
sous la main et fermeraient l’oreille à des conseils que
dicterait la connaissance réelle des marchés lointains. Eh
quoi! tandis qu’en Belgique tous les industriels jouissent
d’une réputation de vigilance justement acquise, tandis
qu’autour de nous tous les peuples rendent justice à l’excellence
de notre coup-d’œil, à la supériorité de notre esprit pratique,
de notre savoir industriel, ceux-là seulement qui appartiennent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
à l’Industrie Cotonnière feraient exception à
la règle commune! Seraient-ils donc sortis d’une race
autre que celle qui jadis, après avoir approvisionné toutes
les contrées de leurs étoffes, surent donner leurs artisans
pour maîtres à toutes les nations?</p>

<p>Si donc, Messieurs, l’on vous disait que la détresse de
l’Industrie n’est le résultat que de l’ignorance, de l’entêtement
ou de l’apathie, de votre propre mouvement vous
sauriez en mettre la cause ailleurs. Et en effet, pour
apprécier la valeur des hommes qu’on traite avec tant de
dédain et si peu de pitié, voici ce qui vous frapperait
d’abord:</p>

<p>Depuis 1835, de graves écarts out été commis en industrie;
on a fait plus d’un faux pas. L’industrie Cotonnière
s’est abstenue de toute extravagance. Elle ne s’est
pas laissé émouvoir; et se tenant soigneusement en dehors
de tout calcul d’agiotage, elle est restée attachée aux principes
de morale qui seuls fécondent le travail. Elle ne s’est
trouvée mêlée à toute cette agitation que pour voir renchérir
tous les objets de première nécessité.</p>

<p>Cependant une crise est arrivée. Dans ce moment
critique pour le pays, l’Industrie Cotonnière a su encore
conserver une assez bonne attitude. Au milieu de nombreuses
catastrophes, ceux de ses établissements qui marchaient
encore sont restés debout. Les hommes qui se
sont conduits ainsi n’étaient assurément pas des industriels
incapables.</p>

<p>Mais à la suite de ces circonstances calamiteuses et nonobstant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
tous les préparatifs qu’en hommes prévoyants ils avaient
saits pour tenir tête à l’orage, ils se sentent aujourd’hui
lentement et douloureusement minés par le mal contre
lequel, tant de fois déjà depuis 1830, ils out lutté avec plus
de constance que de succès.</p>

<p>Ils se sentent dominés, écrasés par l’industrie étrangère.
Le marché intérieur chaque jour leur échappe et chaque
jour aussi se resserre devant eux l’espace qui leur restait
au dehors pour écouler leurs produits.</p>

<p>Par là se trouve pleinement confirmée la déclaration
parlementaire de 1835 que l’Industrie Cotonnière n’est
pas suffisamment protégée, que la législation douanière est
insuffisante.</p>

<p>Veuillez prendre la peine, Messieurs, de réfléchir sur la
situation de l’Industrie Cotonnière et vous reconnaîtrez
ce qu’elle a de singulier et à première vue d’inexplicable.
Nous sommes tout aussi habiles que nos concurrents de
l’étranger; la situation topographique de la Belgique est
avantageuse; à certains égards, nous pourrions travailler
avec autant ou plus d’économie que beaucoup d’industriels
d’autres contrées; et cependant, si l’on ne doit rien changer
à l’état de choses actuel, il nous est bien décidément impossible
de soutenir la concurrence. La lutte nous deviendra
mortelle à la longue.</p>

<p>Et pourrait-il en être autrement? Nous partageons notre
marché intérieur avec nos voisins, nous ne pouvons pas
aller partager le marché de nos voisins avec eux. Ils viennent
chez nous, nous n’allons pas chez eux. Il y a là une<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
cause constante d’inégalité, car nos concurrents commencent
par réaliser chez eux des bénéfices qui les mettent à
même de vendre à plus bas prix en Belgique. La véritable
économie pour un fabricant est de produire le plus qu’il
peut dans un temps donné. Pour vendre à bon marché,
il faut vendre beaucoup, c’est une vérité démontrée. Or,
notre consommation est trop minime, réduite qu’elle est par
les introductions étrangères. Pour les impressions, par
exemple, les frais de gravure d’un rouleau sont les mêmes
en France et en Angleterre qu’en Belgique. Avec le même
rouleau un fabricant français fera 500 pièces; un fabricant
anglais 5000; un imprimeur belge n’en fera quelquefois
que 50. Il en est des impressions sur étoffes comme des
impressions sur papier; le livre qu’on tire à un nombre
considérable d’exemplaires, se vend à peu de chose près
pour le coût du papier. Les étoffes imprimées qui arrivent
de France ou d’Angleterre en Belgique, s’offrent à un prix
qui représente la valeur du calicot.</p>

<p>C’est surtout en temps de crise qu’il devient impossible
aux fabricants belges de résister à cette concurrence écrasante.
Ce qui par dessus tout fait du mal à notre industrie,
ce sont les soldes de magasin, que périodiquement nos rivaux
de France et d’Angleterre envoient dans notre pays,
avec ordre de s’en défaire à tous prix. Tel tissu de coton
imprimé qui au printemps aura été vendu par eux à 3 fr.
l’aune, fera partie huit à neuf mois plus tard de ces envois
de pacotille qu’on sera content de vendre à un 1 fr. 50 et
même 1 fr. 25 l’aune. Voilà donc les cotons les plus fins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
et les plus chers, mis en concurrence directe avec les articles
courants du pays. Les fabricants étrangers, avant de
commencer une nouvelle campagne avec leurs dessins nouveaux,
font maison nette de ce qui leur reste en magasin;
et c’est particulièrement la Belgique qu’ils inondent, car
ils ne veulent pas gâter les prix sur leur marché principal,
qu’ils se réservent à eux seuls. A tout prix ils doivent
donc exporter; et par sa situation, la Belgique est à portée
de tous.</p>

<p>Plus la mévente est générale chez nos voisins et plus l’inconvénient
que nous signalons devient ruineux pour notre
pays. Nous souffrons de nos crises, nous souffrons encore
plus de celles de l’étranger; car si jusqu’à un certain point,
on peut avec de la sagacité voir venir les premières, comment
prévoir les secondes? En ce moment ce n’est pas à
1 fr. 50, ni à 1 fr. 25 l’aune que les impressions de Mulhouse
sont offertes en Belgique, on les obtient facilement à
1 fr. 10 l’aune de France, faisant l’équivalent de 64 centimes
pour l’aune de Brabant; et c’est à ce prix avili que des
voyageurs, après les avoir fait entrer moyennant 8½ p. c.
de prime de fraude, transport compris,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> les colportent dans
les villes et dans les plus petits villages de la Belgique.
Que sert aux fabricants, contre de pareils débordements
d’étoffes, et leur vigilance, et leur rigidité, et leur économie,
et leur esprit d’ordre et de calcul. Ils ne peuvent qu’affirmer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>sans crainte que personne puisse les démentir, que de
pareils prix présentent de la perte sur le prix de revient des
étoffes qu’ils fabriquent et impriment.</p>

<p>A ceux qui leur reprochent de ne pas s’occuper assez
d’exportation, tout ce qui précède peut déjà répondre;
mais qui donc pourrait méconnaître que, pour exporter
avec fruit, il faut être assuré d’abord d’un certain débit sur
le marché intérieur? Le marché intérieur est donc indispensable,
et pour les fabricants belges, c’est justement ce
qui leur manque.</p>

<p>L’Industrie Cotonnière avait dans les Indes Néerlandaises
un débouché que les faveurs spéciales, accordées au pavillon
et aux produits des Pays-Bas, devait rendre exclusif à son
profit. Tout le trop plein de la fabrication intérieure
s’écoulait donc vers ces contrées, dont la consommation
s’accroissait de jour en jour. Le marché intérieur venait-il
à être surchargé de marchandises, soit par un excès de production,
soit par une introduction surabondante de fabricants
étrangers, le fabricant cessant de produire pour la consommation
indigène, allait écouler à Java ce qu’il avait en magasin,
sans être obligé de suspendre ses travaux. Dans le
même temps le marché de la Hollande toute entière, où se
trouvent 2 millions ½ de consommateurs, lui était ouvert en
concurrence avec l’étranger. Quelques préférences lui
étaient pourtant accordées. Aujourd’hui le débouché des
Indes Orientales est perdu, celui de la Hollande se perd
tous les jours, parce que nous y retrouvons comme en
Belgique le trop plein, les queues de partie de la France et<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
de l’Angleterre; naguère encore nous avons perdu dans le
Limbourg et le Luxembourg 350,000 concitoyens et consommateurs.
Voilà les faits dans toute leur vérité. Comment
après cela soutenir encore que la situation actuelle de
l’Industrie Cotonnière est tolérable, qu’elle est meilleure
qu’en 1830. Encore une fois, MM. les Représentants,
votre bon sens, votre patriotisme, se soulèveront contre d’aussi
grossières erreurs. Et reportant ensuite votre pensée sur
la sévérité de la politique commerciale suivie par des nations
voisines, vous vous direz qu’une seule voie de salut reste à
notre industrie la possession de notre marché intérieur.
Vous nous le donnerez, Messieurs, en retirant aux étrangers
la part que la fraude leur a jusqu’à présent laissé prendre,
ou vous nous adjoindrez à un plus grand territoire.</p>

<p>Nous vous prions donc de nous assurer, mais de nous
assurer par des moyens efficaces, ce qui est notre droit légitime,
c’est-à-dire la possession du seul marché qui nous
reste, ou d’y suppléer soit par une réunion douanière avec
la France, soit par l’accession à la ligue commerciale allemande.
C’est notre seul espoir de salut. Nous vous
prions encore de vous occuper de cette situation sans retard,
nos souffrances sont vives, elles durent depuis long-temps;
si contre toute attente l’impossibilité de nous secourir devait
être finalement reconnue, comme dernière faveur, nous demanderions
qu’on voulût bien nous le dire. Nous en profiterions
pour abréger notre longue agonie, et pour en finir
avec les sacrifices, avec ces luttes dans lesquelles nous
dissipons à la fois notre temps et nos capitaux. Ainsi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
Messieurs, c’est encore un service que vous nous rendrez si
par votre intervention nous obtenons que le Gouvernement
s’explique.</p>

<p>Mais nous en sommes convaincus nous n’aurons pas fait
un appel inutile à vos lumières pas plus qu’à votre patriotisme:
vous le savez et jamais votre cœur ne l’oubliera, de
l’existence de nos établissements dépendent directement
plus de 10,000 familles, plus de 50,000 individus y compris
les hommes, les femmes et les enfants; ils appartiennent à
toutes les provinces; aux campagnes tout aussi bien qu’aux
villes; et vous sentirez que si ce moyen de travail leur était
enlevé, il serait absolument impossible de leur en procurer
un autre. Vous sentirez donc la nécessité de réunir vos
efforts pour conserver à la Belgique une branche d’industrie
qu’une volonté ferme sauvera, et qui n’attend qu’une resolution
vigoureuse pour grandir, et s’affranchir du tribut
qu’elle paie à l’étranger.</p>

<p>Vous jetterez les yeux sur l’importance de cette branche
de fabrication, sur la somme de capitaux qu’elle employe et
sur celle qu’elle représente; et vous vous direz que si un
jour, par excès d’indifférence, on permettait que des établissements
dont en 1835 votre commission centrale a
estimé la production annuelle à 45 millions de francs
s’écroulassent, les reproches qui viendraient atteindre les
auteurs de cette catastrophe ne pourraient jamais être trop
sévères. Vous ne voudrez donc pas en gardant le silence,
que qui que ce soit puisse jamais essayer de faire peser
l’accusation sur vous. Il vous suffira de dire que la déclaration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
faite par vous en 1835 n’a pas cessé d’exister;
vous inviterez le Gouvernement à remplir sans délai les promesses
qu’il a faites; et vous pouvez être certains, Messieurs
les Représentants, que désormais les vœux que vous
exprimerez en notre faveur seront d’autant mieux accueillis,
qu’au Ministre qui, en plus d’une circonstance, refusa
de nous entendre, a afin succédé le représentant de la ville
de Gand, qui en tant d’occasions se constitua le défenseur
de nos intérêts. Qu’il exécute comme ministre la politique
qu’il a soutenue comme député, et l’Industrie Cotonnière
sera sauvée; elle renaîtra bientôt du milieu de ses débris.</p>

<p>Agréez, Messieurs les Représentants, l’expression de notre
profond respect.</p>

<h3>No. IV.</h3>

<p class="center">EXTRAIT D’UN MÉMOIRE.
<br>
<small>ADRESSE LE 3 OCTOBRE 1814,</small>

AUX HAUTES PUISSANCES ASSEMBLÉES DANS LE
CONGRÈS DE VIENNE,
<br>
<i>Par MM. les Vicaires-Généraux de Gand, dans l’absence et
suivant l’intention expresse de Monseigneur le Prince de Broglie,
évéque de Gand</i>.</p>

<p>“Depuis l’établissement de la religion protestante en
divers pays de l’Europe, on ne connaît aucun peuple qui,
devant être gouverné par un prince d’une religion différente
de la sienne, n’ait pris auparavant toutes les précautions
possibles pour mettre l’exercice libre de son culte, tous les
droits <i>et priviléges qui y étaient attachés</i>, hors de toute atteinte
de la part du souverain.”</p>

<p>A l’appui de cette proposition MM. les vicaires-généraux
citent plusieurs exemples choisis dans l’histoire d’Allemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span></p>

<p>“Les Belges, disent-ils ensuite, sont d’autant plus
fondés à solliciter des hautes puissances cet acte de justice,
que:</p>

<p>I. La religion luthérienne et la réformée ne sont, à
proprement parler, que <i>tolérées</i> en Allemagne par les constitutions
de l’empire germanique, ainsi que la religion
catholique, attendu qu’il répugne au bon sens d’approuver
des religions qui se contredisent. Mais dans la Belgique,
la religion catholique a été constamment et authentiquement
approuvée de tout temps.—Les Belges sont donc à bien
plus forte raison fondés à invoquer un droit de garantie
formel en faveur d’une religion qui n’a jamais cessé d’être
la leur depuis leur conversion au christianisme, et dont
l’exercice <i>exclusif</i> leur a été constamment assuré par les
traités les plus solennels.</p>

<p>II. Tel est d’ailleurs le véritable intérêt de S. A. R.
le prince d’Orange; car, on ne peut le dissimuler, une assez
longue expérience a prouvé combien les Belges sont attachés
à leur religion et en même temps très chatouilleux
sur cet article.... Dès le règne de Marie-Thérèse ils eurent
à se plaindre plusieurs fois de l’influence de la philosophie
moderne sur les mesures de l’administration. On sait que
Joseph II, n’ayant plus gardé de mesure, employa vainement
des voies d’autorité pour obliger les Belges à adopter
ses nouveaux plans <i>inconciliables avec l’indépendance de la
jurisdiction ecclésiastique, et qu’après une assez longue lutte ils
en vinrent enfin jusqu’à secouer ouvertement le joug</i>. Un prince
plus puissant et plus redoutable ne réussit pas mieux à<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
subjuguer leurs esprits. La terreur de son nom et la multitude
de ses troupes aguerries maintinrent les Belges dans la
dure oppression; mais il ne parvint jamais à leur faire recevoir
les institutions impériales, celles de l’université, le catéchisme
de l’empire, ni même les quatre articles du clergé de
France.... On ne peut nier que S. A. R. le prince
d’Orange ne réunisse en sa personne toutes les qualités propres
à lui concilier les cœurs de ses nouveaux sujets. Mais
les qualités les plus distinguées et les plus aimables d’un
souverain ne sauraient être pour le peuple qu’il doit gouverner,
une garantie suffisante de la conservation de ses droits
en matière de religion. Il n’est pas impossible que ses successeurs
ne soient pas aussi favorablement disposés que lui.
D’ailleurs les principaux dépositaires de son autorité, ne
peuvent-ils pas exercer sur l’esprit du prince une influence
très pernicieuse aux vrais intérêts de la religion?... La
plupart des hommes d’état n’attachent plus, de nos jours,
au maintien de la religion de leur pays la même importance
qu’on y attachait autrefois.... Au lieu de <i>se borner à protéger
la religion, à faire exécuter les lois de l’église, à punir les
actes extérieurs nuisibles à la société religieuse</i>, ils s’immiscent
témérairement dans les affaires de la religion.</p>

<p>Le véritable intérêt de S. A. R. le prince d’Orange est
donc qu’un pacte inaugural assure aux peuples de la Belgique
la conservation de leur religion, <i>dans toute l’étendue de
leurs anciens pactes inauguraux</i>.</p>

<p>III. C’est aussi l’intérêt de l’Europe.... Il importe
infiniment au succès du nouveau système politique, que la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
Belgique soit aussi tranquille, aussi heureuse qu’elle peut
l’être, et que par conséquent on ne laisse point germer dans
l’esprit des habitants des semences de défiance, de division <i>et
de trouble, dont il serait un jour extrêmement difficile d’arrêter
le funeste développement</i>, si l’on ne pourvoit d’avance à la
stabilité inaltérable de l’état de la religion, <i>tel qu’il existait
autrefois</i>. Pour cet effet, il entrerait dans les plans d’une
saine politique <i>de rétablir dans ces provinces les anciennes constitutions
... nous ne pouvons calculer les résultats d’un autre
système</i>; mais si l’on ne jugeait pas à propos de rendre à la
Belgique ses antiques et vénérables institutions, ... nous
supplions les hautes puissances assemblées dans le congrès
de Vienne, de stipuler dans le traité définitif de cession de
ces provinces à S. A. R. le prince d’Orange, les articles
suivants de garantie en faveur de notre sainte religion:</p>

<p>1º <i>Tous les articles</i> des anciens pactes inauguraux, constitutions,
chartes, etc. seront maintenus en ce qui concerne,
le libre exercice, les <i>droits</i>, <i>priviléges</i>, <i>exemptions</i>, <i>prérogatives</i>,
de la religion catholique ..., <i>des évêques, prélats, chapitres,
avec cette exception, que le prince souverain et son auguste famille
seront libres de professer leur religion et d’en exercer le
culte dans leurs palais, chateaux et maisons royales</i>, où les
seigneurs de sa cour auront des chapelles et des ministres
de leur religion, <i>sans qu’il soit permis d’ériger des temples hors
de l’enceinte de ces palais, sous quelque prétexte que ce soit</i>.</p>

<p>2º Les affaires ecclésiastiques resteront en mains des
autorités spirituelles, et ce sera aux autorités ecclésiastiques<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
que l’on devra s’adresser pour tout ce qui tient à la religion,
sauf à recourir dans les affaires mixtes au conseil d’état.</p>

<p>3º Le conseil d’état ne sera composé <i>que de catholiques</i>
et il sera extrêmement important, pour ne pas dire nécessaire,
qu’il s’y trouve au moins deux évêques.</p>

<p>4º La nonciature sera rétablie à Bruxelles. Le <i>conseil
d’état traitera seul avec le nonce</i>, au nom du souverain, des
affaires ecclésiastiques dont ce prélat devra connaître, la
nomination des évêques, etc.</p>

<p>5º Il y aura un nouveau concordat avec le St. Siége.</p>

<p>6º Il est absolument nécessaire que la dotation du
clergé soit irrévocablement fixée, et qu’elle soit indépendante
de l’autorité civile. “<i>Pour cet effet il suffirait de rétablir
la dîme.</i>”—En revanche la contribution foncière pourrait
être diminuée d’un cinquième, et la dîme imposée d’un
cinquième.</p>

<p>7º L’université de Louvian sera rétablie....</p>

<p>8º L’entier rétablissement de la religion catholique avec
tous les droits et prérogatives y attachés, suppose la liberté
donnée aux corporations religieuses de se réunir et de vivre
suivant leur vocation. Un des plus excellents moyens, et
peut-être le seul qui existe aujourd’hui, d’assurer aux jeunes
gens une éducation qui réunit tout à la fois l’esprit de la
religion et les talents les plus éminents, serait de <i>rétablir les
jésuites dans la Belgique</i>.”</p>

<h3>No. V.</h3>

<p class="center">EXTRAIT DU JUGEMENT DOCTRINAL
<br>
<small>DES</small>
<br>
ÉVEQUES DU ROYAUME DES PAYS-BAS, SUR LE SERMENT
PRESCRIT PAR LA NOUVELLE CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p>“C’est pour remplir un des devoirs les plus essentiels
de l’épiscopat, pour nous acquitter envers les peuples sur
lesquels le St.-Esprit nous a établis évêques pour gouverner
l’Eglise de Dieu (Act. 20, v. 28), de l’obligation qui nous a
été strictement imposée par l’Eglise, que nous avons jugé
nécessaire de déclarer qu’<i>aucun de nos diocésains respectifs
ne peut, sans trahir les plus chers intérêts de la religion, sans
se rendre coupable d’un grand crime, prêter les différents serments
prescrits par la constitution</i>.”</p>

<p>Les signataires du jugement doctrinal indiquent ensuite
les principes qui, selon eux, “sont contraires à l’esprit et
aux maximes de la religion.” Ce sont les art. 190-196,
226, 143, et le 2e article additionnel. Ils observent à légard
de ces dispositions:</p>

<p>“(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 190 et 191) 1º Jurer de maintenir la liberté<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
des opinions religieuses et la protection égale à tous les
cultes, qu’est-ce autre chose que de maintenir, de protéger
l’erreur comme la vérité?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 192) 2º Jurer de maintenir l’observation d’une
loi <i>qui rend tous les sujets du roi, de quelque croyance religieuse
qu’ils soient, habiles à posséder toutes les dignités et emplois
quelconques, ce serait justifier d’avance et sanctionner les
mesures qui pourront être prises pour confier les intérêts de
notre sainte religion dans ces provinces, si éminemment catholiques,
à des fonctionnaires protestants</i>.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 193) 3º Jurer d’observer et de maintenir une
loi <i>qui met dans les mains du gouvernement le pouvoir de
faire cesser l’exercice de la religion catholique, lorsqu’il a été
l’occasion</i> d’un trouble, n’est-ce pas faire dépendre à l’avenir,
autant qu’il est <i>en soi, l’exercice de notre sainte religion
de la volonté de ses ennemis et de la malice des méchants</i>?</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 196) 4º Jurer d’observer et de maintenir une
loi qui <i>suppose</i> (!) <i>que l’église catholique est soumise aux lois
de l’état, c’est manifestement s’exposer à coopérer à l’asservissement
de l’église</i>. C’est au fond soumettre, suivant l’expression
de notre saint-père le pape, la puissance spirituelle aux
caprices de la puissance séculière. (Bulle du 10 Juin, 1809.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 226) 5º Jurer d’observer et de maintenir une
loi qui attribue au souverain, <i>et à un souverain qui ne professe
pas notre sainte religion, le droit de régler l’instruction
publique, les écoles supérieures, moyennes et inférieures</i>, c’est
lui livrer à discrétion l’enseignement public, <i>c’est trahir
honteusement les plus chers intérêts de l’église catholique</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 143) 6º Jurer d’observer et de maintenir une
loi qui autorise les états provinciaux à exécuter les lois
relatives à la protection des différents cultes, à leur exercice
extérieur, à l’instruction publique, n’est-ce pas confier les
plus grands intérêts de la religion à des laïques? ... <i>à dieu
ne plaise qu’aucun enfant de l’église concoure par un serment
solennel à maintenir un tel ordre de choses!</i></p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Art.</span> 2 addit.) 7º Jurer de regarder comme obligatoires,
jusqu’à ce qu’il y soit autrement pourvu, et de maintenir
toutes les lois qui sont maintenant en vigueur, ce serait
coopérer évidemment à l’exécution éventuelle de plusieurs
lois anti-catholiques et manifestement injustes que renferment
les codes civil et penal de l’ancien gouvernement
français, et notamment de celles qui permettent le divorce,
qui autorisent légalement des unions incestueuses condamnées
par l’Eglise, qui décernent contre les ministres de l’Evangile,
fidèles à leur devoir, les peines les plus sévères (?)
etc. Toutes lois qu’un vrai catholique doit avoir en horreur.</p>

<p>Il est encore d’autres articles qu’un véritable enfant de
l’Eglise ne peut s’engager, par serment, à observer et à
maintenir...; <i>tel est en particulier le 227me qui autorise
la liberté de la presse</i>.</p>

<p>Nous avons dû considérer ces articles, en eux-mêmes,
et sous le rapport des funestes effets qui <i>doivent</i>, tôt ou
tard, résulter de leur exécution. Le caractère connu de
notre auguste monarque nous donne sans doute un juste
motif d’espérer qu’il daignera, par sa royale sollicitude, en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
preserver autant que possible ses provinces catholiques, qui
forment la majeure partie du nouveau royaume; <i>mais des
qu’une loi humaine est intrinséquement mauvaise et opposée
à la loi divine et aux lois de l’église, on ne peut, sous aucun
prétexte, s’engager d’y obéir</i>.”</p>

<p>1000 livres of Ghent thus cost 10f. 95c.; and as there are
2300 livres in a ton of 1000 kilogrammes, the price, as compared
with M. Briavionne’s statement, would be 25f. 18c.
per ton. I have, however, mentioned that the price has
fallen considerably since the panic of 1837 and 1838, which
accounts for the difference.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> This estimate, given to me on the spot, I have reason to
think must be incorrect, as in 1838 it was valued at but half
this sum; and even its subsequent enlargement and addition
can scarcely have doubled its value within so short a time.</p>
